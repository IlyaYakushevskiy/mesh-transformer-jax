   September 1, 1993 England, Knigs Cross station platform 9 and &frac34; 
    
    
   The first of September is a wonderful day, a festive day, and an irrevocably awful day in its utter hopelessness. Ilya, still somewhat elongated from the summer, glistening with his bronze tan, evenly laying all over his body, collected a full house of stares.
   Not that it annoyed him, but he still didn't like being stared at like a sculpture. He wanted to pick his nose, and he couldn't do it, because there were always people who would notice. A nightmare, in a word. And then there's the Golden Trio, who were supposed to be watching Ilya. Mol Mrs. and Mister had asked the judicious Harry and Granger to keep an eye on the recently reclined Zec. Surprisingly, the boys agreed. Granger because she couldn't pass up the opportunity to boss someone around and show her supposed adulthood. Harry simply because he didn't know how to say no to other people's requests. Ron was the only one who wasn't happy with this turnaround, and neither was Ilya himself.
   - Ilya, take off your hat," Granger suddenly demanded as the four wizards finally found an almost empty compartment.
   Except for the sleeping man on the top shelf, there really wasn't anyone in it. Ilya, sighing heavily, shoved his trunk under the seat, solely because of the goblin mannerisms grafted onto some part, assisted Hermione in shoving her torch onto a vacant shelf. Discreetly showing the middle finger to the entire trio as they turned to paper and finally stretched out on one of the seats, occupying it completely.
   The end of the vacation was just perfect. Ilya was so full of two excursions that he spent all his free time on the beach. There he managed to meet a simply monstrous amount of people. He made friends in Belgium, Ukraine, Japan, Macedonia, France, Germany, Poland, America, Mexico, Brazil, Canada and... He had friends in Belgium, Ukraine, Japan, Macedonia, France, Germany, Poland, America, Mexico, Brazil, Canada. Ilya managed to find a common language with everyone, and in the case of girls, also a place where these languages could touch. Weasel played beach football, volleyball, took part in jumps from the cliff, parachute flights for the boat, in the get-togethers in bars and nightclubs, played strip poker and more interesting things, managed to try all alcoholic beverages and understand their measure, once again escaped from the police, and drove a sports car on the night Sheikh, completely ignoring traffic lights. In general, Ilya had more fun in the six days he had left on vacation than he had in Egypt in a whole month. In the end, it seemed to Ilya that those six days were the longest and most intense in his whole life. There was an unstoppable dance of emotions and feelings that swept over him and left no chance.
   Weasel grinned. Hardly another fourteen-year-old could boast of such a summer. 
   - Ilya...
   - Piss off Danger," Weasel snorted, putting his foot on his leg and pulling his hat over his eyes.
   If in his first year he could stretch to his full height on the seat, now he lacked space and had to lean with his back against the opposite wall. Through the approaching drowsiness, Ilya heard the click of his heels and the click of the key latch. When the know-it-all returned to his seat, Weasel drew his wand.
   - Alohomora! - without looking, he said.
   There was another click, letting me know that the lock was no longer locked.
   - Hey!" exclaimed Ronald. - Why did you open it?!
   - You know," Ilya stretched out. - After you've done your time, you appreciate such niceties as unlocked doors.
   - You've only been in detention for a week," the Scary Square wizard didn't see, but suspected that the second best in school, grimaced slightly dismissively.
   - When you've done the week yourself, then you can lecture me.
   - Mrs. Weasley asked me to keep an eye on you.
   - I'll look after whoever you want," Ilya said with a smirk. - But looking out doesn't involve lectures or lectures or anything else.
   - Hat...
   - Get away from my hat. But if you want me to strip, I might as well start with my pants.
   - It hurts me to have you undress," the girl grimaced again.
   - Who knows," Weasel shrugged, putting his hands behind his head. - Maybe you got a hormone injection over the holidays after all.
   - You're just a horny juvenile delinquent.
   - Where did the poser go?
   The atmosphere in the compartment gradually heated up, but in time there was someone who always comes in at the right and unnecessary moment.
   - Will you calm down already? - He sighed questioningly. - Ron, what do you know about Sirius Black?
   Weasel mentally slapped his hand across his face. After such a tumultuous summer, he had expected a year of tranquility in the ancient castle, but it seemed the Wizarding World had its own idea of tranquility. This was the third year in a row that some sort of cavabunga was brewing at the school. The first year had psychotic minions of the Dark Lords, the second year had black-magic artifacts capturing the minds of little girls, the third year had a maniac escaping from the most impregnable prison. At this rate, by the seventh year, Hogwarts will be at war...
   - Not much," Red answered rather dejectedly. - Just that he was right-hand man of You-Know-Who and was condemned right after the war. My father said he'd gone mad and killed thirteen muggles, and Peter Peter Petergrew, who was left with only his little finger.
   - Nihu... - even Ilya was shocked by such a scope.
   - Harry! - Hermione exclaimed. - Mr. Weasley told you to keep your voice down and stay out of trouble. Black is after you, and instead of asking around about him, you should follow the rules and regulations for once in your life.
   - Goggles, I'll bite my tongue off, but I agree with Danger. Stick your asshole in the chair, see if the school gets in any less trouble.
   - I didn't ask you, you filthy slug!" barked Weasley.
   - You're a filthy slug," Ilya rolled the insult around on his tongue. - Look, how about something new? Well, I do not know, disgusting, for example. No, I understand that your mind is not enough for more, but still... I don't know how you got to be like this, Bill or the Twins or even Percy, the smartest guys, but you...
   - Oh, you...
   - Ron!
   Ilya lifted his hat with his index finger and saw Potter holding his flamboyant friend by the forearm. Ron looked at his mate, and the bespectacled man nodded at the unknowing stranger snuggled up on the top shelf. Weasley's attention immediately shifted from one to the other.
   - By the way, who's that? - Ronald suddenly lowered his voice to a whisper.
   Yeah, well, by golly, a genial fellow. The sleeping man was not awakened by the locomotive whistle or the tapping of the wheels or the drumming of the rain or the past shouting, but now - he would certainly wake up, and so it was necessary to whisper. Yes, in such situations one begins to believe that some people need their head solely to eat into it.
   - Professor Lupin, our new ZoT teacher," Hermione replied calmly, scratching the neck of her huge cat, Bellybutton. A perfectly normal cat, with a distinct admixture of magical blood.
   However, such a statement made Weasel gasp.
   - How do you know? - Potter voiced the question hanging in the air.
   - I read it on the suitcase tag," Danger shrugged, enjoying the purr of the shaggy cat. 
   Ilya put his hand to his face again mentally. How had he not thought to look at the tag himself? Perhaps Ronald's mental awkwardness was airborne. However, Ilya went up anyway to look at that very tag. And indeed, it read, "Professor Remus Lupin, Defense Against the Dark Arts."
   - You can Danger," Ilya coughed.
   Then he suddenly sucked in air too hard with his nose and froze for a moment. The man smelled strange. Not the way a human should smell, and Ilya had learned everything there was to know about smells over the years. The Slytherin sucked in the air again and again, sniffing and puckering like a leopard on the prowl. Even his facial features took on a slight beastly shape for a brief moment, unnoticed by the others.
   This Lupin did indeed reek of the forest, and, rather suspiciously, of wolf. But it wasn't a put-on smell that you put out after a walk or an encounter with an animal, it was this man's personal scent. But even though Ilya loved such smells, the professor smelled a little different. Not pleasantly refreshing, but rather a little dirty and sickly. It was not a real forest and wolf, but only some semblance, and - magical. A sudden hunch crossed his mind.
   - Danger, when was the last full moon?
   The girl was taken aback and opened her mouth silently.
   - Oh, hurry up, I know girls know how to do these things.
   - Yesterday," Hermione replied.
   Weasel turned around, looked intently at the Trio, and realized that they didn't understand anything.
   - Yeah," Ilya stretched out. - Fuck, Grandpa's gone crazy. Maybe I gave him some expired slices. - The weasel bent over, took out his trunk, opened the lid, and began to rummage through the pockets, muttering: - "Where's he... Where'd it go, you little bastard? There you are!
   He took out a shiny little thing, which turned out to be a cross on a chain. It was a gift from the priest. But it was not a simple cross, but a cross made of pure silver. And silver is known to be an excellent antidote to those who smell of woods and wolves.
   Ilya quickly put the chain under his shirt, and then hung the cross on his chest. He would have to wear it for a year. Why a year? Well, Zotniks don't hold out much longer. Must be too much of a chore. Ilya had little faith in the "cursed position" version.
   - All right," Weasel put the trunk back and patted himself on the knees. He pulled a pack of Pirate's Dream from his breast pocket and a Zippo lighter from his back pocket, which now not only bore the emblem of the famous whiskey, but a variety of Junior runes and even one Senior. - Who's up for a smoke break?
   The oil painting was a break in the paradigm of existence. Only seeing cigarettes in the hand of a classmate, the homeboys fell into a natural slump and could not even get their eyes together.
   - What, no one? - Ilya was a little disappointed.
   Over the last few days of rest he had become accustomed to spending his breaks talking rather than proudly alone.
   - You... are you... are you smoking?! - Granger burst into tears, blushing at what she thought was blatant behavior.
   - Everything is clear with you," Ilya sighed and went out into the corridor, slamming the door behind him.
   He was expecting a furious Danger to burst in, but she was either too dazed, or finally realized that Ilya's reeducation was out of her league. And anyway, no one was up to the task.
   Ilya went to the window, pulled the handle, and opened the window. A drizzle of whipping rain hit his face, and the night smell hit his nostrils. The train had already passed the city and even the settlement areas and was now puffing among the fields and grasses. Ilya flicked his flint, lit a cigarette, and then took a pleasure inhaling the slightly stupefying smoke, enjoying the aroma of the sea breeze. After holding it in his lungs for a while, Weasel gave out five thick smoke rings - he had been taught to do it by a Canadian, a normal guy who smoked not tobacco but some kind of vegetation, which made Ilya burst into an uncontrollable chuckle.
   The night wind caressed my face, carrying white, dense smoke like the clouds of Lilliputian country-small but fluffy. Thoughts slowed down a little, the soul became calmer, and everything around seemed slow and measured. On nights like this, Ilya always wondered how his friends from the shelter. Maybe Rosie was already doing her best to fight off the suitors, and Kevin was helping her with it. It was no secret that Brix was in love with the redheaded kid. No one but the kid herself. As for Gavs, he was probably learning the hard science of boxing, which he was a fan of, going insane in his adoration.
   Or maybe the three friends were sitting in their room at St. Frederick's right now, fuming just the same, looking out the window and thinking about how their friend was doing in that strange academy called Hogwarts. And Ilya would, upon hearing such a question, instead of answering, hold out the pile of letters he'd been writing every Friday for the third year now. The room, after each line, would be ringing with laughter and friends would often mock their friend. And he, without blushing, would proudly stick out his chest and lift his chin.
   Ilya looked at the half-cigarette. Yes - smoking alone is a shitty thing to do. It always makes me want to philosophize, or something close to it. But then who to smoke with at school? Only two of the older ones smoked, but they were, how should I put it, addicted to each other. I didn't want to join their company. The only other smokers were Snape and Sprout.
   Weasel chuckled, imagining him trying to snatch a cigarette from the Half-Eyed Man. Perhaps the Dean would even share - he just wouldn't get over the shock that someone would dare approach him with such a request. That would just be a stunning joke, worthy of a mention on par with Mourning Week.
   The cigarette was only a third of the way through, and Ilya's thoughts turned to the new school year. When the list of additional subjects was posted on the bulletin board, the Slytherin didn't even think about which ones to choose. Of course he put his name next to "Numerology" and "Ancient Runes".
   Numerology was taught by Professor Vector, the best in her field. In that work, which the young man has been reading for a long time now, even her forums, theorems and examples of solutions of certain equations were mentioned. Ilya was even a bit surprised that a world famous scientist teaches in an ordinary school. But why be surprised if Hogwarts is ranked first in this very world.
   Ancient Runes was maintained by Batsheda Babbling, whose last name was also a household name. She was responsible for many translations of ancient texts and manuscripts, and many libraries around the world would have been honoured to host such a distinguished researcher. But the professor preferred to combine work with teaching, and, once again, the best school in the world was ideally suited to it.
   Perhaps, once Ilya had started the classes, he would be able to do more research and finally get closer to the main thing: creating his own spells. For that Ilya already had almost everything ready. The first and most important were the ideas for the charms. The second was the structural equations, which was the most important. The calculation of one of Ilya's spells, for example, took up three meters of parchment scroll. All that was missing was the non-verbal component and the Elder Runes.
   Ilya, using his unorthodox mind, decided that by combining multiple aspects in his spells, he could create something that would quite equal his chances against any forehead. He was led to this idea by the numerous records of Duel League fights that Flitwick had supplied him. Ilya looked through dozens, hundreds of fights, going over them time after time, noticing every detail, every nuance. And in his mind, spells, their structures, their purposes, their uses, and the ways in which they were used, loomed up. But once again, it was all about nonverbalism and the Elder Runes. Without them, all he could think of were numbers on parchment and images in his head.
   Exactly ten charms, exactly ten equations, that's all Ilya got out of himself, knowing that he would never get out again. But if he could manage to master them, if he could use nonverbal magic on par with verbal magic, it would be enough to make his road to the King of Doom's crown a red carpet. It would be enough to "roll the dice" with any lunatic with a wand loaded with magic accumulated over generations of pureblood ancestors or innate talent.
   After all, Ilya had his own talent, too, besides music, of course. After all, by his sophomore year he could rival Hog's graduates in fire spells. No matter how weak Ilya was at magic, fire obeyed him as easily as a lighter that lit up with a click. It didn't even require much effort or any amount of magic. As easy as breathing.
   The cigarette suddenly went out, and an icy sliver slashed across my cheek.
   - What the... - Ilya stretched out, when the train stopped abruptly at full speed.
   Ilya was saved from an imminent fall by his reaction and dexterity. He jumped up and grabbed the handrail, landing on his feet a moment later. But that was not the end of the surprises.
   The recent rain that had been pouring down outside the window had suddenly turned into hail. And now it was not drops, but stabbing ice balls and needles that were ramming on the glass. And the glass itself began to be covered with a crust of painted frost, crackling in more and more space.
   The light in the corridor flickered, and then went out altogether. A liquid but acrid mist spread across the floor, crawling and wriggling like a ball of snakes. Illya began to suffocate. A pungent smell wafted across the floor, like the fumes of a snake. It was rotten, filthy and not even death, but a kind of death. It was as if there were ghosts here, but ghosts that were dense and tangible, that remained in this reality, but no longer alive.
   Ilya's stomach twisted, his eyes tingling with the stinking stench. He was in the middle of a fight, and he was trying to concentrate, but then the stench doubled in density. 
   And when the icy vestibule door creaked miserably, the Slytherin, the only one in the corridor, saw them. They were flying black tatters of cloak, like gaps of an abyss in a sparkling reality. And wherever they floated by, everywhere the light flickered, everything around them turned gray, turning a swampy haze. Suddenly their hands appeared from beneath their cloaks. Ilya had seen enough dead men in his life and had never been afraid of them. But these scab-covered hands, with their hard, parchment skin, were clearly the hands of a corpse, but unlike the others, they were truly frightening. 
   Because of the stench, Ilya felt wild weakness, his body could not hear him and Ilya collapsed, sliding down the wall. The two cloaks drew nearer, and the cold grew stronger. And with it, the despair grew stronger. It was as if someone had drained him of what seemed to be his inexhaustible joie de vivre. The most terrible memories began to roll in Ilya, but he brushed them off, not wanting to remember and sink again. Ilya had never lived in the past and easily left all evil behind, replacing it with the heat of life.
   The two cloaks approached almost closely, but then one suddenly turned sharply away and literally burst into the compartment where Trio was sitting. And that other one, just like that, snapped toward Ilya. And with every centimeter of approach, the stench and fear combined with despair intensified.
   Ilya, breathing heavily, literally drowning in sweat, raised his wand. He didn't utter a word or make a single gesture, but a faint jet of flame burst from the tip of his red wand, ornamented with scrolls. Cloak let out a low squeal, recoiled, letting the fire pass behind him, and leaned toward Ilya.
   The cloak was thrown back, and Weasel was only able to hold back a gagging urge with shock. There, beneath the hood of black, flowing fabric, was no face. There was only a round, toothless mouth on his head, stretched out like a Scream painting, open like a trumpet. Everything around it swirled in a nauseating whirl, everything faded, and the world focused only on this failure.
   Ilya felt that he was falling, falling, and could not grasp, because inside his own mind there was nothing to grasp.
   
   
   
   - Look who it is... - heard Ilya.
   He opened his eyes and saw an angel before him. That's what he thought for the first ten seconds, until he heard it.
   - Say 'mama,'" the angel said in a voice that flowed with streams of honey.
   And Ilya heard a childish, very childish voice:
   - Ma-ma," and then I realized it was him talking.
   It was his throat that emitted those sounds, and it was his chubby little hands, like stretched wieners, that reached for the angel's face. To those fine, perfect facial features, to the chiseled nose and cheekbones, to the perfect cut of deep, bright blue eyes and thick but graceful spreading eyebrows. To the thick, black hair that rivaled the color of a moonless night. A smile so kind, so caring and gentle that I wanted to look at it forever. And to the endless warmth that exuded from this most beautiful of women.
   The woman suddenly opened her eyes, fluttering her long lashes like butterfly wings.
   - Faust, Faust! - the woman shouted. - Our son has spoken!
   At the same moment there was a deafening clatter of feet and a new participant appeared on the stage. Ilya probably should have blinked, frightened, screamed with horror, but he only laughed his laughter, similar to the murmur of spring drip. A man appeared before him. The man's face was not human but shaped like a beast, like a leopard or a lynx.
   The narrow eyes sparkled with their animal emeraldness and dilated but still narrow pupils. A body, too inhuman a body, encased in an armor of knotted muscles and veins stretched like steel ropes. And the hair, the man's hair was not red, but bright red, like a newly blooming flower of flame.
   But the little boy, the one-year-old child, was not afraid; it laughed and stretched its arms toward this monster in the flesh, as others would call it. But to Ilya this someone was not a monster at all, he was:
   - Really? - There was a low, growling voice, like a forest cat's sniffling. - What did you say?
   The girl with the angelic face smiled and pecked the child on the nose.
   - Baby, tell Daddy again what you told Mommy.
   The child laughed and squeaked again:
   - Ma-ma.
   - It's... it's... fucking...
   - Faust! Not in front of the children!
   - Oh, yeah, I'm just worried," the red-haired man said. - This is the happiest day of my life! Say "papa," say "papa."
   And he held out his hand to the child, a hand so powerful that it would have passed for a paw, even the nails on the fingers were identical to the claws. But again the child was not frightened, but only grasped the finger, topped by a sharp claw, firmly.
   - Pa...
   But no sooner had the last sound escaped the infant's lips than a terrible rumbling sound struck my ears. The walls trembled, plaster crumbled from the ceiling, the front door flew off its hinges, landing with a pop on the floor, and there, in the darkness dispersed by the glow of the fireplace, Ilya made out a female figure in a dark robe. And then Ilya heard laughter, the maddening laughter of a woman.
   - Hide," Faust bellowed the frightened angel. - Hide yourself and hide him. I'll hold her off.
   Angel suddenly kissed the red-haired man hotly, and when their kiss ended, Ilya saw surreal long, dangerous fangs protruding from his upper and lower jaws. 
   The girl threw Ilya into her arms, but for a moment the child's head was over the angel's shoulder, and he saw. He saw the red-haired man turn toward the fireplace and wave his hand. And with that sweep, a torrent of bright, roaring flame swirled, enveloping all the space around it.
   Then all the child could see was the blue dress of an angel carrying him in her arms. They were near the wall, the girl pressed something somewhere and a niche opened in the wall.
   - Be quiet," the girl whispered suddenly. - I beg you, Ilya, don't make a sound.
   Then a kiss on the forehead and the phrase:
   - I love you.
   Angel pressed something again and the alcove slammed shut. The child was left in the darkness and had only the sound of voices breaking through the crackling flames.
   - You thought you were hiding here. Fiery? On this side of the world?
   - Don't say that name in front of me.
   - And you used to like it," and a laugh, so scary, so crazy.
   - Get out, get out now.
   - No!" the laughter broke off abruptly into a shriek. - He has fallen!
   - What?
   - He's fallen! The Dark Lord has fallen! And it's all because of you! You left, you gave up everything for her! ...for a Muggle pipsqueak! But I found you, I found you, and I will punish you for your treachery.
   Silence.
   - You don't know anything... he never told you.
   - Shut up!" and that high-pitched, ear-splitting shriek again. - He was telling me everything; I was the closest thing to him!
   Silence again and the crackle of flames.
   - Why are you standing there, Fausto? Why aren't you attacking? Or do you think I came here to drink tea? - ...and a laugh, a mad woman's laugh. - Even the Longbottoms were fighting and you're standing there.
   - I'm not fighting anymore, Bel...
   - Don't you dare!
   - Okay, um... I don't fight anymore. I was stupid, and I paid the price for it, but I found something more important than my own hatred. Go away or shoot, but not a drop of magical blood will touch my hands again.
   - And why, because of her? Because of a dirty muggle?
   - And because of her, too. But also because of the fact that you can't hold children with bloody hands.
   - Children? - laughter again; the woman seemed to be laughing all the time, literally gasping in her madness. - You can't have children, you're the last one.
   And the laughter never ceased, wild, crazy, like a brand of hardened iron in my subcortex. And then silence and the crackle of flames.
   - Still standing?
   - Shoot or get out.
   - Fausto's last wish? Rejoice in my mercy.
   - Don't touch her. Let her go. I was a monster and I have to pay for it, but she's innocent.
   - All right.
   - Swear it.
   - I swear. Farewell Fireman. Bombarda Maxima!
   And then a cracking sound, as if someone had cracked a watermelon with a bat, and a terrible cry of pity, mixed with wailing. But that was drowned out by the crazy woman's wild laughter. There was silence as the flames crackled, and then came footsteps. Clear, measured, but interspersed with the clatter of heels and muffled laughter.
   - There you are...
   - Go away, go away! - The angel shouted, choking back tears.
   And laughing, such a nasty, crazy laugh and phrase:
   - I lied-- Crucio!
   And the screaming...
   
   
   
   Something snapped Ilya out of those forgotten memories. It was as if a star had fallen into the valley of despair and fear, woven of happiness and joy. Ilya opened his eyes again, but this time in real time, in the real world, not the one the dreams had thrown up.
   Weasel saw the cloaks fly away, shrieking violently, and a silver blur rushed after them, but when his vision returned to normal, for a moment weasel saw in the blur a huge dog. Soon the cloaks and the dog disappeared behind the doors of the vestibule.
   - How are you, boy? - There was a man's voice, a little hoarse.
   Ilya realized that he was sitting on the floor, drenched in sweat, and the sleeping man was leaning over him. The man's face was haggard and troubled.
   - Everything all right? Harry was hurt, too, but at least they didn't try to drink his soul. Here's a candy bar to help.
   Weasel brushed aside the chocolate bar and it rolled across the floor. The professor did not take offense at all, and only tried to help him stand up, but was instantly pushed aside. Weasel, holding on to the handrail, got to his feet and suddenly realized that he was cold. For the first time in his life the wizard of Scary Square was cold.
   - It's freezing in here," Ilya's voice was a little mechanical, as if he wasn't thinking, just acting on instinct.
   Now Lupin was surprised. It was even hotter in the room when the Dementors left, but looking at the young man who had almost been kissed, one would have thought otherwise. Suddenly the tanned skin turned from bronze to yellow, and his lips and nails turned blue.
   - We need to warm up," whispered a still uncomprehending Ilya.
   The wand soared in a bright spark, the glass shattered, and Weasel leaped out into the street in a fused leap and ran. He ran as fast as he could to fan the flames in his chest, and his path lay through the woods to the place that would surely help in this difficult matter-the Magical Forest.
   Ilya could almost hear the worried whispers of the wind and the leaves begging him to hurry, before the flames went out completely, before the young man lost something important that the dead man in the cloak had almost taken. For just a little bit more, just a little bit more, and the Forest would not be able to fan those flames.
   Needing to run faster, Ilya ran down the path that emerged beneath his feet, and not even the wind could catch up with him. 
 

Chapter 24.
   September 6, 1993 England Hogwarts
    
   Illya had a dream. In the dream an angel sang to him, and that angelic voice drew Ilya deeper and deeper into a whirlpool full of warmth and comfort, from which he did not want to get out. But one way or another Ilya had to open his eyes and part with this divine creature of incredible beauty.
   Weasel stretched himself sweetly, squeezing his eyes and wrinkling his nose, and then with a yawn rose to his feet. He was surprised to find himself in a pile of leaves. Someone had covered him with branches and grass, making a blanket of green.
   The Slytherin looked around and saw only the morning forest. The crones were whispering their otherworldly stories overhead, the trees crackling and the wind whistling in the grass. And through the tall, dense foliage, rays of light broke through like sharp spokes, playing in the dust of the forest.
   Ilya pinched his arm, but it didn't help. He was awake. But reality was so impossible that even the wizard found it hard to believe what was happening. The last thing Ilya remembered was going out for a smoke, and he was attacked by dead ruffians in cloaks and tried to take away his sight, well, or soul. In general - Ilya hung out with Dementors, but they were clearly having some problems with a beautiful third-year and decided villains try him for a tooth. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.
   The only thing weasel remembered was a dream that flashed: an angelic maiden's face, a clawed paw hand, and some crazy, scary laughter.
   - I'm in this mess again," Ilya sighed and slapped his hand across his face. - And it's probably because of Potter again. 
   Thank the gods of all religions, the hat was still there, as were the rather expensive (by the standards of the bosot) shoes and trousers. The only thing was that the shirt was torn to shreds. Ilya did not hesitate, threw off the rags and hung them on a bough. Maybe the centaurs would pick it up for bandages or something.
   There was nothing to do, no ideas, so it was no surprise that Weasel drew a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his pocket, where he found a whole one, then flicked the flint. The smoke swirled, creating spirals and rings, and, with his hat tucked slightly over his forehead, he threw his hands behind his head and strode off down the path that led to Hogwarts.
   Occasionally there were animals on his path, often stopping to stare intently at the lad walking along the path. The sun danced playfully on the bronze skin that stretched over his knotted muscles. And the young man, seeing some furry one, took off his hat to greet him. And fluffy, in turn, wagged his tail, flicked his paw, twitched his ear, and then he went on his fluffy business. Everyone had their own thing to do. Someone had to bring something to burrow, someone to get a worm, a bug, a mouse, or even larger prey. Some were caving in a hollow, some were looking for a dam support, and some were just strolling serenely through their territory.
   At some point Weasel stopped, bent down and pulled off his shoes. He stuffed his socks into his pockets, and they stuck out comically. The weasel tied the shoes himself by the laces and hung them round his neck.
   With pleasure he dug his toes into the still dewy ground, burrowing into the cold, caressing grass. He gave out another batch of smoke rings, and Ilya, not worrying about anything, began to whistle his favorite tune. And as if in tone with this tune three little birds were flying from tree to tree trying to make a trill in time with the tune. Weasel saluted them with his hat. And so the four of them continued on their way through the Magic Forest.
   The path looped, leading Ilya along paths unknown to the other traveller, glimpsed at times the strangest trees, more like bushes, and bushes the size of trees. Ilya passed a field of singing flowers, and jumped over a ravine in which the stones laughed, but everything around him seemed a little familiar and quite normal. Even a squirrel dancing a jig with a salamander was something quite ordinary to the young man. But the closer weasel came to the castle, the more ordinary the forest became. Here no more would one encounter a tree with a human face, or a snuffer basking on a rock, or even a special bird with four wings. It seemed that the very essence of the Wizarding Forest was trying to stay away from Hogwarts, revealing only the very edge of true, genuine wonder.
   Weasel paused beside the tree for a moment, then smiled and stepped out into the clearing.
   - Well done, Harry," he heard Hagrid say in his thick, low bass. - I was a little scared at first.
   There were Gryffindor and Slytherin third graders in the clearing, which was a short walk away from Hog's fields. There was a full complement except for Daphne Greengrass and Theodore Nott. Weasel looked at Granger somewhat incredulously. He had reasonably assumed that the nerd would choose to take Numerology and Runes, or at the very least, Muggle Studies. But the fact that the nerd in the skirt would be taking the UZMS Practice.
   
   Hagrid helped Potter down from what might appear to be a huge horse. But the snag was that the horse had eagle claws on its feet instead of hooves, and the head itself was eagle-like, and it even had wings and half of its torso was covered with feathers. In general, it is pleasant for you to get acquainted with hippogriffs, chimeras in which the eagle and the Andalusian stallion were mixed.
   Then someone turned his head toward Ilya, who was standing shirtless, leaning against a tree, smoking his cigarette. It was Lavender. She was batting her eyes in disbelief, then suddenly she was eagerly devouring the figure of the young man and tugged at the sleeve of her friend Isabelle, who in turn poked her elbow at Parvati.
   - Aloha pioneers," Ilya waved his hand.
   Here the Slytherin gathered a full house of stares. And everyone was looking at him with different shades of emotion in their eyes. Malfoy and Co. looked with obvious regret and pity. Some of the Gryffindors looked with surprise, the trio of girls with quite familiar shades of desire from the summer, well, the Trio was in their own spirit and represented the apogee of shock.
   - Ilya? - Hagrid spoke up.
   - No, I am the shadow of Hamlet's father, come to inform you of a terrible sin.
   - Did you lose your shirt for sin? - Suddenly McDougall giggled.
   - Yeah," the Slytherin grimaced. - I was so caught up in the sin that I could barely find my pants.
   Someone laughed, someone blushed, and Ilya, finishing his cigarette, burned the cigarette butt in the flame of the stick. He was not littering in the Magic Forest. 
   - Ge... - Hagrid wanted to say something, but didn't have time.
   There was a high, high-pitched screech, and by now the focus of attention was across the clearing, where a bloodied Malfoy lay on the ground, clutching his left arm to his chest, three deep slashes showing. A hippogriff was looming over the weakly breathy man, wings flapping violently, then he sprang to a halt, forelegs outstretched, clearly intent on finishing the job.
   Alas, between Draco and the chimera arose the forester, whose powerful figure at this moment inspired nothing but consternation. Hagrid waved his arms and began to drive the beast away, which, with obvious displeasure, nevertheless obeyed. And how can one not obey here.
   - Relax Beak-wing," exhorted the new UZMS professor. - It's all right, Beaky. It's okay.
   - All right?! - squealed Parkinson, who was leaning over the pale Malfoy at that moment. Although, it was surprising that this 'aristo' could turn even more pale. - Draco is dying!
   Hagrid was taken aback, but then he pulled himself together, and not just himself. He lifted Draco, who was whimpering like an abandoned girl, into his arms like a fluff ball. The students were visibly frightened. Everyone except Trio, because they'd seen worse, and Ilya, because... because he's Ilya. That kind of says it all.
   - Class dismissed," the woodsman's voice returned instantly to normal in moments of peril or perceived peril. - I'll take Draco to the Hospital, all of you to your living rooms. Ilya, Professor Dumbledore is waiting for you.
   The ranger blew his whistle and the hippogriffs began to walk away deep into the forest. As Ilya passed by, the young man stretched out his right arm.
   - Welcome to the club," Ilya smiled, hinting that more than one flyer had bled a weakling.
   Surprisingly, the hippogriff snorted a little mockingly, winged his arm, and disappeared into the woods. Weasel, with his hands behind his head, staggered barefoot behind the group of joking students. All of them were discussing the scene of the Slytherin's wounding as one. The Paleface Aristo gang, of course, were pissing and shitting themselves, promising the school in general and Hagrid in particular the worst punishments. They were talking about how great everything had turned out, except that Draco hadn't died. Here it was Ronald who was the most zealous, tried to be saddled by the famous pacifist and humanist, Granger.
   The weasel, who had tailed Scarlet, was getting close to the three friends. Lavender had managed to build up at least a size two this summer, and Isabelle and Parvati were starting to round up in all the right places, too. But after the Egyptian beach and clubs, Illyadaje didn't need to strain to keep her eyes off of cleavage or short skirts. These girls were no match for the theme girls and ladies.
   However, the three girlfriends never got a chance to chat with their mate, as Hermione turned to Illya.
   - Where have you been?! - barked the nerd. - The whole school has been looking for you for three days!
   - Flattered," Ilya nodded, and as if nothing had happened, he wandered on.
   The nerd stayed behind, dazed and stunned by such a statement. Soon she came to her senses and caught up with the young man.
   - What do you mean, flattered?
   - I'm flattered that...
   - You know what I mean! - shouted Danger. - I'm going to tell Mrs. Weasley everything!
   - I'm going to go ahead and do it," Ilya shrugged. - I could even put a medal on your chest. I'm amazed, by the way, that it's started to grow on you.
   Hermione was taken aback again, but then Ron, who had been listening in on the conversation, got involved.
   - Oh, you...
   - It wasn't an insult, Red, it was a compliment," Ilya sighed. - Well, maybe not quite a compliment, but a bit of an insult. But you fucked me up...
   - I think the summer in Egypt has been a good one. - I see that my summer in Egypt was not in vain.
   - Even got a glimpse of Prophet," Lavender interjected, fluttering her eyelashes flirtatiously.
   Only Parvati alone remained silent and glanced sideways at Seamus. Ilya squinted slightly, racked his brain for a second, and then picked up on the situation. Most likely one of the twins and Finigan had started 'dating'. In quotes, because they were only thirteen years old. So this whole "dating" thing is highly conventional. More like an agreement to hold hands and only kiss each other.
   - And he's done his time," Ronald-something-his-Weasley inserted his five pence with a great deal of schadenfreude.
   He must have been pretty pissed off that Brown and McDougal had spotted Ilya in the photo, but not him, Ronald. And how could he be noticed when there were seven other redheads just like him. But really, Weasley was wasting his time. The girls were just enjoying flirting and flirting with the handsome Slytherin, they didn't think much more of it. It was akin to a close dance on the verge of a foul. Just a pleasant pastime, dangerously tickling the nerves.
   - Do time? - Isabelle's eyes widened. - Tell me.
   - Oh ladies," sighed Ilya theatrically. - Most important advice - don't drink with the Russians. Never. Never. Drink. With Russians.
   By this time the students had reached the castle and Weasel had to take his socks out of his pockets and his boots off his neck. But despite the fact that he had his shoes on, he still had nothing to wear on his torso. Ilya did not think long about it, but simply waved and went on.
   If the students had managed to change a little over the summer. Who got taller, who got denser, who got fatter, who got fatter, who got prettier, who got pimpered, the castle was strikingly unchanged. It seemed and there were not those three months of sun and fun, because Hogwarts, against the background of growing organisms, was frozen in time a rock. The same atmosphere, the same smell of cloth and stone, the same emotions when looking at paintings and tapestries. The best school of Witchcraft and Sorcery in the world shone with its permanence, and there was a special appeal about it.
   But all the beautiful mystery of the ancient stronghold of magic was shattered by the equally mysterious rustling of cloth against old stone. The famous Bat appeared on the horizon, able to arise at precisely the moment no one fucking needed him. Although, if you think about it, then any moment Snape appeared would be exactly that. Because who needs him anyway.
   - Mr. Ilya," the potter hissed. - You seem to enjoy putting on a show at the beginning of the year.
   - By no means, sir! - the young man resented. - Performances are for actors; in my case it is a concert.
   A wave of laughter swept through the crowd, which was immediately silenced by the stare of the school's head bastard.
   - It seems that you worked as a stripper over the summer, Mr. Ilya," Snape curved his thin lips in a sneer, alluding to Ilya's semi-nudity. - But Hogwarts is not a nightclub.
   - Yes," Ilya stretched out, looked around, and tapped his finger on his chin, as he always did when he thought about it. - I don't see a pylon here. But maybe I'll be able to show my class without it.
   And again a wave of laughter, this time more distinct. Snape started to boil, but didn't make it to the explosion as the school bell rang, announcing the end of class.
   - Change and march to the Headmaster," Snape muttered through gritted teeth, and turning one hundred and eighty, he himself went to Dumbledore's tower.
   - Gentlemen, don't be too fond of me," Ilya sobbed feignedly, and then headed for the dungeons,
   whistling the same immortal tune.
   
   
   
   
   Twenty minutes later.
   
   
   
   
   Ilya did not betray himself. He rolled up the sleeves of his school uniform and robe in such a way that he looked like a medieval samurai or a rocker who had recently returned from a concert. And, not surprisingly, the second option was much closer to him.
   The gargoyle was in no hurry to show good or even proper manners this time. At first the young man thought of a supposed password, and then slapped his hand on his forehead. He quickly pulled out of his pocket the hat of Pharaoh (well, you didn't think that Ilya forgot about the promise to give the stoner something appropriate, and certainly didn't think that he would leave his trophy to the police). Having placed a simple but ancient crown on the head of the guard, Weasel bowed his head to the side, and then corrected the right edge.
   - She's a beauty, I'll give you that. Wear it in good health. It's from Egypt itself.
   The gargoyle would have smiled if she could have, but she just moved aside, opening the doorway. Well, now Ilya was bribing, and not just anyone, but magical statues. I wonder if such nuances are included in the resume. Just in case. If you've managed to bribe a stone, you can bribe anyone.
   Ilya went up the winding staircase, and then knocked manically on the tall doors. But just as his knuckles touched the carved ornament, the doors swung open, letting the boy into the oval office.
   Nothing had changed here, just like in the rest of Hogwarts. On the many shelves, behind the glass, among the crystal vials and vials, were all sorts of devices. Many hissed and snorted, some buzzed and whirled, others made some impossible, almost indistinguishable sounds.
   On the walls hung portraits of past principals and headmistresses, who, as usual, did not hiss at the young man, who gave them a jutting middle finger. A table with carved feet in the shape of lion's paws stood by the window. The table, lined with red cloth, was piled with piles of papers and other implements and work stuff. And behind the table, on the largest and most painted cabinet, littered with books and other things, lay an ancient hat, whose song Ilya had again missed. But of course we can't forget the perch with the red phoenix, the first, and most desperate fan of Ilya's music. Although the first one was kind of a white lab mouse, but not the point.
   The local "council of elders" was already gathered around the table. Old McGee, all flashing her stern, horn-rimmed glasses and the posture of a queen. Snape, perpetually dissatisfied with everything, by the way, is it possible he has that face because the potter is allergic to all the shampoos in the world? Flitwick, cozily ensconced in a little armchair, seemingly even dozing off. And of course the grandfather of the country, the Great Light Wizard, head of the Wizengamot and just a good-natured, cheerful old man - Albus Dumbledore, who is clutching at his vase with lemon wedges.
   Ilya turned his head toward the cupboard and almost fainted, from the amount of security charms of the highest order. Apparently sweets were very important to Albus.
   - Shalom, gentlemen of the jury," Ilya nodded.
   He made his way to the table and plopped down in the chair that had appeared. Flitwick, at the sound of a falling body, perked up, yawned, rubbed his eyes, and then clapped the Slytherin on the shoulder. The young man nodded at some part of the goblin and, against his will, blurted out a welcoming smile. He probably missed this old man after all, but just a little bit, yes - just a little bit.
   - Minus twenty points for rudeness," the transfiguration professor snorted.
   Ilya even choked and was immediately slapped on the back by the enchantment teacher.
   - Ma'am, either you're anti-Semitic or you have no sense of humor.
   - And twenty more," McGonagall smiled predatory, feline-like.
   - But...
   - Ilya, shut your mouth," Snape hissed. - Otherwise our faculty will lose all their points.
   Weasel covered the bread-cutter and went about his every business - he began to poke in. He did not even understand what they wanted from him. So he spent the night in the woods, went out - who doesn't happen? In the end, you could gather the board, if Ilya lost his head from hormones and some pretty and hunted senior girl had a little "Ilya," and perhaps even a few. But Ilya confidently resisted the mind below the belt buckle and remained relatively innocent.
   - I see the summer's been rather entertaining, my boy," Dumbledore chipped away mockingly, in his own style, nodding towards the beautiful, obviously musical tattoo on his left arm.
   - Oh, is that what you mean? - Ilya waved his hand. - Don't even ask who did it-I keep it a secret under pain of axes of the head.
   Flitik grunted, Dumbledore smiled into his beard, Snape muttered an indignant swear word under his breath, and the Iron Lady nearly fainted.
   - I see you've already made up your mark," she coined like a steel press.
   There was silence in the office, but a silence that was unusual, a kind of harshness.
   - Um," Ilya stretched out a confused Ilya. - Actually, the sign was invented by a monk named Guido of Aretha in the year one thousand twenty-four. By the way, he's the muggle who first thought of recording music. But it looks good, doesn't it?
   - It's amazing," Dumbledore nodded. - I remember when I was twenty, I wanted to stab a gryphon on a... I was in my twenties, but it didn't really matter.
   - Why didn't you?
   - I turned out to be allergic to salamander saliva," the headmaster sighed genuinely sad.
   - Trouble," said the young man, upset for the old man.
   Don't forget that the hat present here now noted that the kid truly has a heart too big, inherited from his mother.
   - It's a long time ago," Dumbledore waved his slice. - And I've got a scar under my right knee that matches the pattern of the London Underground Railroad perfectly.
   - Whoa! Oh, wow!
   - I knew you'd appreciate that, my boy," Albus sparkled his eyes. - But now we're gathered on another, more important, but less interesting matter.
   Ilya nodded, letting him know that he was ready for full cooperation and that he had nothing to hide. Except for the fact that the gargoyle now bears the crown of the ancient kings of Egypt, but that's another story.
   - Where did you spend those five days, my boy?
   - I was in... - the young man began his story, but then stumbled at the half word. He opened his deep, bright blue eyes wide on the dark whites, and even gasped intermittently. - Five days? - With a wheeze he asked. - Are you kidding me?
   But, from the looks on their faces, no one was joking. Even Flitwick's eyes were gone from mockery to stern concern. Not to mention McGee, who was as ready to latch onto Ilya's throat as a cat on a captured pigeon. As for Snape, he didn't care, as long as someone's inkblood was spilled and a reprieve was ordered. Natural bastard.
   - But... but... but I...
   - What is the last thing you remember, my boy? - Now Dumbledore's voice, too, exuded a warm concern.
   Ilya began to go over the picture puzzle of the past in his head.
   - I remember going out for a smoke...
   - for a smoke? - McGonagall blubbered.
   - Professor," Flitwick pleaded. - Withdraw your points later, we're discussing a more important matter now.
   - But smoking is strictly prohibi...
   - Minerva, dear, I have to agree with Filius," Dumbledore interrupted the argument with a wave of his hand. - Please continue, Ilya.
   Ilya nodded again and continued:
   - So, I went out for a smoke in the vestibule. There I opened the window and noticed that the rain was too slanting, as if we were driving down a slope. Then I was smoking, and thinking about my own things. And then suddenly my cheek got stiff. I looked and there was not rain, but hail. Suddenly it got cold and stank of corpses. I got twisted, I only had time to get my stick. I was in my head, and then I was in my head, and the next thing I knew, I was in my head, and I was in my head.
   - Do you know what Dementors are? - Snape interrupted the student.
   - I think I can read," the boy shrugged. - I was flipping through a book about these muffins. Anyway, there was, like, two of them, or... no, there were two. One was in the room with Potter and them, and the other one was trying to javelin me. I remember just trying to poke him in the nostril with my wand, Harry style, but there was no nostril, just a gap in his toothless mouth. It was disgusting, like the whole block had been doing a lap on that little dove...
   - Mr. Ilya," Flitwick hissed. - You're worrying again, but I admit you're making progress - my ears haven't turned into a tube yet.
   - Thank you, Professor," the brunette in the hat replied a little lethargically.
   - Is that all, my boy? - Dumbledore asked.
   - Yes," Ilya nodded for the third time. - Then darkness. I only woke up in the woods. I was in the woods, though.
   - Yes, my boy?
   - I was dreaming," Ilya began to feel embarrassed, which somewhat surprised those present.
   In their memory, instances of this Slytherin's embarrassment were as rare as a total solar eclipse.
   - Ilya, we are not interested in your adolescent erotic dreams, - contemptuously smirked Salty-haired, traditionally propping himself up the closet.
   - My pants look the same," Ilya grimaced. - If you were right, they'd have to be replaced.
   - I'm not your girlfriend and I don't keep track of your pants.
   - I certainly hope so.
   - Ilya, my boy," either Potter is playing the part of Dumbledore, or vice versa, it's about time they got into a nascent argument. - Can you tell us what that dream was about?
   - Well... - stretched out even a slightly blushing Ilya. - I was dreaming about a girl...
   - Ilya, I warned you.
   - It's not what you think! - Ilya, who was clutching the armrest to his white knuckles, was suddenly furious without knowing why. - It was a girl with an angelic face, and she was singing to me!
   - Did you dream of angels singing? - Dumbledore seemed really surprised.
   - No," Weasel cut him off. - It's just like I said. It was just an angelically beautiful girl, and she sang to me in an angelic voice.
   - Can you see the differences? - McGonagall asked with obvious mockery.
   - Quite substantial! - Dumbledore and Ilya answered together.
   - My boy, you've been gone for five days and you've had us worried.
   - I'm sorry," he grimaced. - I didn't have any such plans.
   - That's why no one will punish you for it," the Headmaster said calmly, ignoring Snape and McGonagall's outrages. - You weren't at the feast, so you don't know the most important news. This year there will be Dementors standing around the perimeter of Hogwarts grounds.
   Silence.
   - It's not a joke.
   - Fuck...
   - Mr. Illya," Flitwick coughed.
   - O- b-a-l-d-e-t-h," Ilya spelled. - Is this about Zack Black and Comrade Potter?
   The director nodded.
   - And that's why you stopped looking, because you thought I'd been sneak peed on by a psychotic maniac?
   The director nodded again, a little disappointed this time.
   - I'm so-so disappointed," Ilya sighed, making the headmaster look ten years older and even droopy. - You'd think some lunatic could take down Ilya from Scary Square.
   - Do you think you could do anything against the man who killed thirteen Muggles? - Snape asked with a tone of sarcasm in his voice.
   - Sure," Ilya hummed. - For starters, the pretzel didn't have his wand-where would he buy it if everyone wanted a bounty on his head. Secondly, after doing so much time with such guards, he clearly moved his head. Third, he's not much of a rationer in a cramped cell, so he's a real piece of work. All in all, it's like shitting... on the pavement. In half a year or so, I'm going to meet that blocked man and now only the infirm would be afraid of him.
   - My boy, you always think logically first," the Great Light Mage said, with a touch of chuckle, raising the corners of his lips.
   Ilya spread his hands, indicating that this was the case.
   - But I hope you're not going after the reward? - The director immediately switched to a sincerely serious tone.
   - If I don't get Black tied up, then no, I won't. I'm going to stay away this year from anything that has a deleterious effect on this beautiful body.
   Ilya poked his finger in his chest and smiled broadly, pirate-like. Snape and McGonagall almost simultaneously rolled their eyes.
   - Then that's the end of our little meeting. Lemon slice?
   - I won't refuse," and Ilya, after grabbing a treat, saluted each and every one with his hat and set off... Well, he was going somewhere, of course.
   
   
   
   
   September 8, 1993 England, Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
   Ilya managed to show his tattoo almost forty times to everyone who wanted to see it during those two days. He was the only one at school who had such a peculiar ornament, which for some reason caused a great stir. However, that didn't keep him from going to his den, where he performed a few Animagic rituals, as well as studying Numerology and Runes. To the boy's dismay, he successfully missed his first Numerology class while lying in the woods. As it turned out, there were only eight people from the third year to attend these lectures. One from Scarlet - Hermione Granger, three from Slytherin - Greengrass, Nott, Ilya, three from Ravens - the silent Chinese girl Lee, Anthony Goldstein - the blond, always sticking his nose everywhere and Terry Booth, the quiet brown, with a keen sense of justice. And then there's the Hufflepuff girl, Linda Stupefy. As you've already figured out, with a last name like that, you never forget a stunner formula. Linda herself was a real gray mouse, one glance at her and immediately forget she existed.
   He was a lot more likely to go to Runes, but the same people from Slytherin, the same people from Scarlet, plus Isabelle, the entire course from Ravens (an exaggeration, of course), and the three with the badger's coat of arms. Ilya didn't really understand why most people needed Runes if they didn't attend Numerology. But it was likely that this science had applications beyond the components of composing new spells. At any rate, the minor runes could be drawn by the hundreds, and used as the weakest of charms. They didn't require any power. I was a bit like a man with a heart.
   - Shall we sit together? - Isabelle asked, leaning against Ilya.
   Tom had to hold on to the girl's weight, for pushing away was not an option. And MacDougall took advantage of it shamelessly.
   - Unless you're using me as a pillow, of course.
   - I promise," the Gryffindor girl squinted happily, but Ilya didn't believe her for some reason.
   There were a lot of people outside the office in the west wing on the second floor, and they were all waiting for the teacher. Many of them were holding huge dictionaries that would not fit in their school bags. Others had piles of textbooks instead of dictionaries, with various examples and explanations. There was no single textbook for Run and the student's main weapon in the subject was the syllabus, and the primary source of all knowledge was the teacher. So having the best witch in her field at school made the students armed to the teeth, so to speak.
   Most surprisingly, since there was no Malfoy or Potter on the horizon, the four-faculty crowd looked quite civil, and no one was in any hurry to bully or stab the others. Even Nott and Greengrass only occasionally glanced at Ilya with mild squeamishness.
   With the first echo of the bell, the classroom door opened. As it turned out, Professor Babling was already sitting there, probably minding her own business. The room appeared very spacious, designed in the form of an amphitheater, just like Flitwick's. So Ilya confidently led MacDougall to the extreme row adjacent to the window. A total of fourteen people entered the classroom, which instantly settled in peculiar islands. Hermione was the only one sitting alone in front of the chair, just a few feet away from the teacher.
   - She looks good-natured," the mate whispered in Ilya's ear.
   The girl had already pulled out her dictionary, an exact copy of which Ilya also armed himself with. He decided to play Bond (he had to have fun somehow) and not to shine his knowledge in two additional areas. And since he could not shine a light on his knowledge, neither could his textbooks, all the fields of which were scribbled with his notes.
   And Babling did resemble Sprout in some ways. She was a bit overweight, but this looked nothing short of natural, giving the older woman a friendly charm. On her head she wore her hair in a bouffant style with many bobby pins. On her face she was similarly plump and round, which smoothed out her age wrinkles. On the whole, Babling evoked a positive impression, similar to that of her herbalist colleague.
   - He'll eat you for talking, you'll know," Ilya mocked the girl in a feigned voice.
   - He's mean," her classmate pouted.
   However, the friendly flirting had to end. Batilda rose from her seat and walked over to the blackboard, on which was a simple junior rune, which Ilya had spent exactly nine minutes studying.
   - It is a pleasure to welcome those who have chosen to study such a difficult and time-consuming subject as the Ancient Runes," Babling's voice was in keeping with her appearance - soft, but at the same time very deep. - Against the title, we will be taking you through the entire realm of the Runes. I should have known you first, but I've known you a little in the past two years and you know enough about me to know me first. So, Runes. Who's already familiar with the subject?
   Only one hand rose above the amphitheater - Danger's hand. Ilya was sure he could tell a lot, too, but he's Bond - he can't, he has to keep hustling.
   - Yes, Miss Granger, please.
   The nerd stood up, fixing her perpetually disheveled bushy brown hair. Apparently Potter wasn't the only one unfamiliar with the concept of combing it after a hot shower. Hermione, as usual before she answered, coughed a little, reminiscent of Ron, or Ronald reminiscent of her, it was hard to tell.
   -Runes," the girl began. - They were the first magic on earth. They were used by Priests, Wizards and Magi to create elemental spells. Despite Muggle misconceptions, the first runes were invented in central Africa, the cradle of humanity.
   - Very good, five points," Babbling nodded.
   Granger seemed a little discouraged. After all, she'd probably hoped for at least a ten. And this was only a five. But it's one thing to be asked by the dean of your own department or a sympathetic professor, and another to be asked by a professional.
   - As Miss Granger pointed out, Muggles also know about runes and what Muggles consider their mystical properties. Who can tell me what those runes are? Perhaps you, Mr. Ilya?
   Ilya did not immediately understand that he was being addressed, and when he did, he took off his hat and stood up and answered.
   - The Futhark runes, ma'am.
   - Absolutely right, one point. I'll give you more if you tell me how many Runes are currently known to mages.
   - Elder and Junior? - Ilya asked mechanically, and then mentally punched himself in the jaw. He was a lousy Bond, Miss Moneypenny certainly didn't approve.
   - Exactly.
   - One thousand one hundred and forty-seven, then.
   - (chuckles) Great. Three points for the entire answer. Sit down, Mr. Ilya.
   Ilya landed on his heel and returned his hat to its proper place. Ilya noticed the way Granger glared in his direction, announcing the season of point competition open. Ilya, as before, didn't give a damn about these competitions. He'd held the title of Best Student for two years now, and no amount of cramming by a crammer would throw him off the podium.
   Weasel turned toward the window, but as he turned away, he pinched his arm. There, in the clearing, walked the Trio. The Trio, staying in full force. Ilya looked at Granger sitting in the classroom, then at Granger walking through the clearing, then again, at the one in the classroom, then at the one knocking on the door of Hagrid's hut, and then... then Ilya squeezed his eyes shut and mentally counted to ten. No, this year would pass without any mystery or trouble. This year Ilya would be the most exemplary student whose goal was solely to learn and have fun and nothing else. No secrets, period.
   Having finished the self-convincing session, Ilya returned mindfully to his studies.
   - Now you are looking at a rune, the Groundsman, a rudimentary rune of old Alvaphite, the use of which will replace the rudimentary lock-locking enchantments. I see you have Herr Stein's dictionaries and Mr. MacDonald's interpreters. For those with dictionaries, the rune is on page seven, in the interpreters, on page three.
   Ilya obediently opened the right page, although he could draw Zemets with his eyes closed, hung-over, left hand. However, Ilya was equally proficient with both hands, so the last nuance slightly fell out of the overall picture, but not the point.
   - It takes an average mage about a week to learn the first rune, and a more predisposed mage about four days. I will be able to see you on the 15th of the month of the month, as a result of these statistics.
   Ilya, after this speech, fell into such a sludge that he even managed to get to the bottom. And when you get to the bottom, it's time to throw out the old paradigm of being and replace it with a new one. But where to take this new paradigm, no one is your adviser. Ilya's hand went up by itself.
   - Yes, Mr. Ilya?
   - Ma'am, may I ask, when do we move on to the study of the Elder Runes?
   - The Elder Runes are an elective in the seventh year for the most accomplished students. Such laden runes are usually too difficult for the human mind, and the rare mage can master at least a few Elder Runes. Did I answer your question?
   - Quite, thank you.
   - Then let's get on with it.
   Ilya slowly burrowed under the bottom of the draft as the world went off its axis and spun in a wild jig. Such an expert simply cannot be wrong, but then it turns out that Pronyra is a genius, and we know very well that he is not. But then how did he manage to master the entire Junior Alphabet and learn one Senior Rune by the time he was fourteen? Perhaps...
   No, no, no, no assumptions and theories! This year is declared free of any mysteries. Ilya activated the self-writing pen, won in a fair bet from a driven fanatic, and began to take notes on the lecture. Despite the fact that much Ilya already knew, but Babling was revealing more and more subtleties that only a professional of the highest level could know. The lecture was really entertaining.
   
   
   
   
   
   Sixty centimeters of outline and a quarter of an hour later
    
    
    
    
    
   - What did you think of Ilya's summer in Egypt? - I'm sure he's ready to kiss Weasley's feet for that kind of generosity. - He's probably ready to kiss Weasley's feet for that kind of generosity, isn't he?
   Slytherin and Gryffindor, who traditionally had most classes in pairs, were standing in front of the ZoT class. Admittedly, Weasel was a little wary. After last year, when he had attended this class only for tests and quizzes, Ilya was very skeptical about the possibility of attending these lectures again. However, perhaps the new teacher will refresh and resuscitate almost dead subject, which for the whole year was taught by the most usual charlatan.
   - Isabelle, what do you think of the runes? - Ilya turned to his three friends, who had finally stopped staring at the tattoo.
   - Very difficult," the girl answered honestly. - I thought it would be easier. But it's certainly better than the Predictions.
   - Hey, Ilya, someone's talking to you," Nott said.
   - You're wrong! - Patil and Brown exclaimed together.
   - Professor Trelawney is a very good professional and profound person," Lavender objected, crossing her arms under her considerable, for her age, breasts.
   -Ilya, your mother...
   Ilya turned sharply towards Nott, the iron blade of his broadsword showing from the pocket of his robes.
   -Are you sure you want to finish that sentence? - almost growled at Ilya.
   His response was only silence. The vultures turned around at the noise, and Granger was probably already about to cause order and inflict calm.
   - I thought so," Ilya snorted, taking the butterfly away and giving it a nice puff. - Gentlemen of my classmates, let's dot the i's and cross the t's. This year's boy is a darling Ilya. And I'm a darling, right?
   - Of course he is," Lavender and Isabelle nodded. Parvati looked toward Seamus again.
   - So, nice guy Ilya cuts back on his association with the Slytherin faculty, to training and Quidditch matches. Going for such a serious sacrifice that literally chokes me with hot tears of regret, in the name of world peace. Peace, brothers!
   - Where were we? - McDougal tugged at Ilya's robe. - Ah yes, Trelawney. Well, your Trelawney is a maniac.
   - And why is that? - Patil and Brown pouted.
   - Because rumor has it, she's in every class she takes a death sentence for someone. I'm sure she did, too, in yours.
   The girls had nothing to say to that, so they were forced to remain silent.
   - I see I've guessed. And who has the honor of being prejudiced?
   - To Potter," Patil whispered softly.
   Ilya's mind immediately clicked and he raised his voice.
   - Ladies and gentlemen, the great prophetess Sybilla Trelawney has prophesied our Harry Potter's imminent death! In connection with this, the Gemini enterprise, in conjunction with Ilya Illya's information office, is opening a sweepstakes. You can find out about the betting in the evening from any Gemini representative. Bets will be accepted until the last exam of the summer session!
   At first people started laughing, but then they realized that Ilya was in no way joking. And Ilya was already thinking how he and Fred and George were going to split the profits, and he had to bring them up to speed. As already said, the orphan boy was spinning and twirling in Hog as best he could. He was always running about, deciding and doing something to get a nourishing piece of pie and a warm bed under his mortal body.
   - How can you bet on that? - Granger shouted.
   Ilya snapped his fingers and answered:
   - There you go.
   Hermione was probably about to wet something like that, but then Peeves came on the scene. Unlike the other ghosts, he didn't just hate Ilya, he was always in a hurry to do something bad to the Slytherin. He didn't touch the rest of the Greens, for fear of Baron's wrath, but the ectoplasmic gray cardinal apparently gave up his goodness on Ilya.
   The poltergeist glided over a group of students, and then literally shot out fresh gum. The gum hit my hat, and I had to struggle to get it out and clean the headgear. But Ilya, with catlike grace and reaction, moved aside, and the gum hit the keyhole, blocking it up.
   Ilya immediately stretched out his right hand and showed Peeves a bulging middle finger. The poltergeist pulled out another projectile, but then it sounded:
   - Vidivasi!
   There was a loud pop, and the gum whistled out of the keyhole, hitting Peeves right in the eye a moment later. Surprisingly, the ectoplasmic howled in pain and scurried away through the wall.
   - Excellent spell, always works against pranksters," said the cheerful Lupin, looking much better than he had the week before on the train. - Your way isn't bad either, though.
   - Thank you, sir. The middle finger is everything.
   The professor hummed and opened the classroom door, into which a flood of students rushed at a moment's notice. Ilya cocked his head warily before entering, and then everyone walked in. The classroom looked as it should. There were portraits of truly famous martial artists everywhere, as well as pictures of the effects of various curses.
   The skeleton of a rather diminutive dragon, the Chinese Fireball, hung under the ceiling, a high ceiling stretching almost seven meters upwards. And the loosely spaced desks seemed to be just islands of something mundane, amidst the genuine darkness and horrors of magic. Pictures of curses alternated with images of dangerous creatures, and at times a skull or even a whole skeleton was visible. That sort of thing never appealed to Ilya, but he figured the atmosphere always had to match the subject matter. And certainly pink curtains and the like were no match for the Defense Against the Dark Arts.
   - Put your bags on your desks and pick up your wands," Lupin said, a little mysteriously, like a gypsy at a fair. - You won't be needing quills and textbooks today.
   - "This is already interesting," thought Ilya, leaving his bag on the desk. 
   Thankfully, his paranoia had subsided a little, and he wasn't as worried about his little girl anymore. He was now leaving her often in Flitwick's private office.
   The people left their junk bags, exposed their wands, and piled up in front of Lupin, faculty-gendered. The new lecturer was a tall man, just past his "prime," about thirty-five years old. His face was extremely intelligent, as were his deep gray eyes, but premature wrinkles were visible, and gray strands in his once black hair. He was dressed in simple, shabby clothes, patched in places, worn in places, and in general he looked little better than Ilya. But when had Ilya ever cared about his professors' clothes?
   Behind his back was a huge wardrobe, which occasionally rattled with wobbly knobs and creaky, unlubricated hinges. At times there were mysterious howls from the depths of the closet, and acrid black smoke billowed from the crevices.
   - So, has anyone guessed what kind of creature I have in store for you today?
   Oddly enough, quite a few hands went up, but asked all the same...
   - Miss Granger.
   - It's a boggart, sir.
   - Absolutely right! Ten points to Gryffindor," Lupin was frankly pleased not only with the correct answer, but also with the opportunity to accrue points. Ilya seemed to already know which department this man was in. - It really is a boggart, I caught him yesterday in the kitchen. What is a boggart, oh, they are relative harmless but quite dangerous creatures. Dangerous in that they can easily throw you off balance. Once you see a boggart, it assumes the guise of your deepest, most secretive, and most terrifying fears. And to meet with such, sometimes not even an experienced mage is not ready. But even against such beings it is possible to fight. All you need to do is imagine your fear in its most comical form and clearly pronounce it - Riddiculus, while depicting here such a flap. Let's all do it together and with a flourish, repeat the formula.
   The flick really was just that, an unfinished figure eight to be exact.
   - Riddiculus! - with a chorus of nearly twenty people shouted.
   - Excellent, just excellent! - Yes, Lupin was really enjoying teaching. - Then I guess we shouldn't put it off too long. Do you have a volunteer?
   There were no volunteers, Harry was discussing something with his sidekick and so he didn't hear the offer to go to the front row, or else he would. Rest assured, he did.
   - Then how about you? Aren't you Alice and Frank Longbottom's son?
   Neville nodded fearfully and took a step forward.
   - Sir, you shouldn't summon Longbottom if you don't want to call Pomfrey later! - Malfoy bellowed, and the rest of the group broke into a desperate cackle.
   - I'm glad you care so much about your classmate," Lupin replied calmly. - But I think he'll do just fine.
   The professor clapped the good-natured chubby boy on the shoulder cheerfully, but it clearly didn't do him much good. Neville clutched his wand frantically and stared wide-eyed at the shaking cabinet.
   - So, Neville, what's your biggest fear?
   - Pfsrsnp.
   - Sorry, I didn't make it out," Lupin exhorted.
   Longbottom squeezed his eyes shut, caught his breath, and spoke clearly:
   - Professor Snape. I'm afraid, Professor Snape.
   A wave of laughter erupted through the classroom, the green ones being the hardest hit, but there were desperate jibes among the vultures as well.
   - Well, no wonder he's hard not to be afraid," Lupin smiled good-naturedly and winked at Neville. - But you wouldn't miss an opportunity to present your fear in a funny way.
   Longbottom at first didn't understand what Lupin (who apparently knew a lot about humor and banter) was hinting at, but then nodded his head a little hesitantly.
   - On the count of three, I open. Get ready Neville," Lupin stepped back to the magic thunderclap that could play with the volume of a concert set. - One! Two! Three!
 
   The preacher waved his obviously willowy wand and the cabinet doors opened. At the same instant, out of the clouds of darkness appeared... Professor Snape in his black, flowing robe. He staggered almost mechanically toward the trembling Neve, extending his first, cupped hand as if he wanted to strangle the boy.
   - A spell, Neville! - Lupin shouted, holding his wand at the ready.
   - Rid-dic-culus! - Longbottom stumbled twice in the formula, and it didn't work. But then the Gryffindor had panted, stood for a moment, and then said the formula clearly.
   With a wave of his wand, a clap sounded, and Snape turned into... "Snape." Instead of a robe, he wore a short fur coat that would fit any nightstalker, bright red high-heeled shoes on his feet, fishnet tights and a dangerous miniskirt above. The neck was adorned with an ancient jabot that had seen more than one kind, and on her head was a pink hat with feathers.
   Everyone was silent at first, but then there was thunderous laughter among the vultures. Everyone laughed. Laughing, choking back tears. Lupin, too, coughed frantically, trying to keep his laughter at bay. Ilya squatted down, arms around his stomach, gasping with laughter.
   - You are the best Nev! - He was in the middle of the night, and he was in the middle of the night.
   Neville smiled tautly and staggered back, and everyone felt obliged to clap him on the shoulder.
   - All right, come on, who's next, hurry up before he hides!
   The students immediately, still chuckling, lined up. Lupin lowered the gramophone needle, and Ilya closed his eyes slightly, enjoying the immortal classic. This tune was impossible not to recognize. "JailhouseRock" from the old Elvis blew up this class. Boggart began to twinkle like a light bulb on a Christmas garland. 
   Here Isabelle stepped forward and with a clap of "Snape" turned into a howling flying skull with glowing eye sockets. A spell was cast, and the skull transformed into a... a skull that glowed with candles instead of eye sockets. There was another burst of laughter and another flicker of boggart.
   Then it was Milicent's turn, whose pie became a giant bulldog who suddenly had a pink dress. Then there were giant snakes that suddenly lost their teeth, spider monsters tap-dancing, zombies hoarse from howling, under-bed monsters frightened by the lack of a bed, a broken broom that turned into an airplane-some-smog. And everywhere there was laughter, blending in with the music of the deceased Croel Rock. Finally it was Ilya's turn, with Potter behind him.
   To make sure the boggart didn't disappear, Lupin had him cornered in the closet for a while. But then the teacher waved his wand, and the weasel, who'd been doing the real twist the whole time, froze. Elvis was still singing about the prison party, and suddenly the closet was shifting. There was a muffled howl, a creaking of bones and the rustle of rotten leaves, a darkness and even a shuddering of the lamp. Blackening fog lay across the floor, a chill enveloping everyone present, and the girls huddled together. The boys clenched their teeth. A moment later, out of the closet... half an apple rolled out of the cabinet.
   - Fucking hell! - Ilya exclaimed, pointing his wand at his greatest fear in life. - Die Riddiculus abomination!
   The apple got legs, arms, a dress, and started can-can-dancing. Lupin chuckled and chased the boggart into the closet.
   - Are you afraid of half an apple, Mr. Ilya? - the professor wondered.
   - I'm afraid of the half of what was in the half of the apple!
   - I don't get it...
   - It was half a worm! - exclaimed Ilya, trembling with disgust. - Half a fucking worm! I can't eat apples after that incident!
   Almost everyone was lying there laughing now. And Lupin, unable to contain his laughter, gestured to Harry. With a flick of his wand, he opened the cabinet doors, then suddenly looked up at Potter with a startled look. Only a puff of smoke managed to pull out of the closet before the professor stepped between Glasses and Boggart. A clap and a voluminous silver orb glistened over the hall, another clap and the orb turned into a deflated yellow ball, which flew with a grunt into the wardrobe. With another wave of his wand, Lupin locked the boggart with magic locks.
   - Bom! Bom!" the bell rang.
   - That was a good one," Lupin said, drowning out the music. - Everyone who defeated the boggart - ten points. Mr. Potter and Miss Granger - fifteen points.
   The students, still impressed by the lesson, began to leave the room and head to the Great Hall for lunch. And all the while Ilya was reflecting on the fact that this was probably the best ZoT lesson of his life. In fact, a professor who knows a lot about music might be the best teacher since Flivetwick. Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be a great year.
   Ilya blew hotly into Isabelle's ear, and, dodging her fist, tossed his bag and raced toward the stairs - he was terribly hungry, but not even a hundred Dementors and Dark Lords would make him eat apples, such fears could not be overcome. 
 

Chapter 25
   
   October 12, 1993 England, Hovagarts
    
    
    
    
   Ilya stretched his legs and lit a cigarette. Things were going pretty well so far. No throngs of Dementors burst into the castle, hungry for the souls of underage and not-so-underage mages. No maniacs were after Potter's, and not only Potter's, warm flesh.  And it was quiet all around.
   In class, Ilya answered exclusively with a positively high score as usual, and for his written work, he never received a grade lower than "P". One time Snape tried to overturn him. Draco, the little twerp, because of his "extremely serious" injury pretended to be a broom. Like he couldn't even eat on his own - Parkinson was spoon-feeding, a gut-wrenching sight to be honest. The worst thing is that he can't even play Quidditch properly - Madam Hook had to rearrange the timetable for him because Malfoy Senior was just as bound up as Snape, and people had forgotten that Slytherin had a spare catcher. So he had to cut the ingredients on potions as well. 
   At first, the Half-Haired Man wanted to give such an honorable position to Ilya, and even made some sort of creeping move in that direction. Except when, for some unknown reason, Malfoy's cauldron exploded, scalding the blonde's face, the Bastard removed Ilya from that high position, replacing him with Potter. 
   That was the end of the misadventures in Potions - the respirator and earplugs were doing a fine job this year as well.
   In the case of ZoT, it was exactly as Weasel had hoped. Professor Lupin turned out to be a really powerful man. For one thing, he always knew how to poke fun at me in a way that made me want to burrow under the ground and sit there for at least eternity. But he also knew his subject matter perfectly. This year the third year had two topics: dark creatures and methods of confronting them, and the fight against malignant curses. And in both these subjects, the professor felt like a fish in water and was able to tell such things, which would not be written in the textbook. All in all, it was great.
   It had become more boring in spells lately, but not because of the esteemed Professor Flitwick, but simply because Ilya had escaped to the fifth year in that area. Although for some part the goblin had recently become less likely to make a colorful spectacle out of the lesson and more and more likely to freeze at the half-word, and then cough hoarsely. At evening classes, the master of spells assured Ilya that it would soon pass, he just caught a magic cold in the summer, so he can't get it out. 
   The herbalism and Astronomy went on as before - Ilya was studying and trying to remember something at least. The Elder Runes, the giant equations of Numerology, the rituals of Animagic, and everything else was just out of place in Ilya's mind. 
   This nuance was most pronounced in Transfiguration. This semester, overtaking the programs by almost half a year, the third year of Slytherin and Gryffindor began to pass the transmutation of living into living. It would seem that after two years of animagogy lessons weasel should have been shrewd on the subject, but because of the chronic lack of sleep, constant physical, magical and mental exercises, Ilya began to fall out of reality frequently. So it happened on one test work, where it was necessary to turn a beetle into a butterfly. Then Ilya almost got the first "B", but in time to correct his mutant mosquito on a swallowtail, McGee did not notice the mistake and did not withdraw the point. Granger, on the other hand, had, for once, decided not to pawn anyone off. Actually, it wasn't because the girl had been awakened to notions, but because she, too, was starting to turn in. So, to be reasonable, the third year was indeed the most difficult and crucial.
   But still Ilya had time for fooling around, for light pranks with clock bombs and what he had managed to steal from the Twins over the summer. The faculty lounges, in which guitar tunes were played regularly, were not neglected either. True, more often Ilya began to notice that the high school girls, using him instead of a plush toy, began to press very different parts of the body, hotter and languid breathing, and generally somehow changed everything a little. Ilya had a reasonable fear that if things continued this way, he would be raped by a mob of witches.
   Not that Ilya was not visited by characteristic dreams, and he did not find characteristic spots in the morning, but every action had its consequences. And any possible consequences of such an action were exceptionally unnecessary to Weasel at the moment. Oh, and he was only fourteen years old. No, of course the elders in the orphanage often dispersed on such topics, but it was more like a tale. So weasel decided to wait another year or even a year and a half before he was introduced to such pleasures of life. 
   - How long have you been waiting? - A familiar voice sounded, blending in with the creak of the door hinge.
   Ilya extinguished his cigarette, tossed the cigarette butt into the far corner of the abandoned office, and looked at his watch. It was five minutes to nine. 
   - No," the Slytherin shook his head and jumped down from the windowsill. - How did you get here?
   - I'm sure he'll be fine," Fred shrugged as he followed his brother out the door. - I've been looking for them for a long time.
   George pushed Creevey and Longbottom forward. The photographer was literally glowing with excitement and anticipation for the adventure, but Neville was clearly apprehensive. He trembled, glancing toward the door as if it were his salvation.
   - Now that we're all set...
   - ... I think you can...
   - ... start.
   - Nev, do you remember your task? - Ilya asked, turning to his classmate.
   Longbottom nodded his head and pursed his lips, breathing deeply. It was his way of calming himself down. Neville couldn't be called a daredevil, but he couldn't be called a coward either, because the chubby boy always knew how to overcome his fears.
   - Reporter?
   - It's gonna be okay!
   Ilya glanced at the twins, who shrugged. 
   - Okay, then I'll open it.
   Weasel stepped away from the group of his companions and, tugging on the rope, unlatched the old, musty chest. Immediately black smoke puffed from the depths of this antiquity, a mysterious howl rang in the ears, and a moment later Professor Snape appeared in the light. This time, too, he held out his right hand and staggered mechanically toward Neville.
   - Nev, burn! - Fred shouted, taking his position.
   Actually, George and Ilya pointed their wands at the boggart and took their places as well, forming something like a triangle, with the illusory Snape as the center.
   - Riddiculus! &shy;&shy;" Longbottom said clearly.
   There was a clap and Snape was once again dressed in a very revealing outfit with the unwavering jabot. 
   - Ilya, we're out! - George commanded.
   The Weasleys raised their wands at the same time as Ilya and the three of them barked:
   - Filopupa!
   The trio's wands released slightly translucent threads. Some were wrapped around the boggart's legs, some around his arms, some around his neck and waist, some around his fingers and even his tongue. In all, there were ten threads from each wand, each of which found its target.
   - My turn," Creevey bit his tongue anticipatorily as he clicked off the first frame.
   - Let's add some jazz, boys! - Ilya smirked.
   After that suggestion, the boggart as Snape began to assume the most "seductive" and "intimate poses." Actually, that's exactly what they would have been if instead of Snape, the boggart had turned into a stunning beauty from Wizarding Girls magazine. But that's who you have to be to be afraid of pretty girls... 
   And Colin kept clicking the shutter, leaving frame after frame on the film. Snape kept twirling and turning, Neville was holding a transformation spell, and Gemini and Weasel were gasping with barely contained laughter. At some point, all five of them erupted. The spells were gone, and the five students were lying on the floor, banging their fists against the ancient stone. Their thunderous laughter made the ceiling shake, made the walls shake. Boggart vanished with a resounding bang, disintegrating into the black smoke.
   Ilya's laughter was a croak, and he was frantically trying to breathe, wrapping his arms around his stomach. Colin sobbed silently, occasionally hiccuping and writhing in pain after such hysteria. The twins tapped each other on the back and gave a thumbs up. And Longbottom still couldn't move and was literally rolling around on the floor.
   The boys had been gone for about five minutes before they all sat in a circle, with their backs to each other. The children had enough time for about five more minutes, and then they all sat in a circle, with their backs to each other. 
   At times one of them would chuckle, and this would cause them all to fall back into an uncontrollable agony of laughter. After that, they would groan and cackle and wipe away their tears again. You could say the evening was a success.
   - A frame for every pose? - Weasel wheezed.
   - How... and... We-we-agreed," Colin pushed through with difficulty, still holding the camera in his hand.
   - We'll share...
   - ... fair or...
   - ... evenly?
   There was silence for a moment, and then another burst of laughter erupted. In the end the people only calmed down after a couple of minutes, when the cries were no longer from laughter, but from pain in the stomach and lungs. 
   - Shall we vote? - Nev suggested.
   - Who's for even? 
   Five hands went up in the air at once. No one wanted to bother with "fair". 
   - Unanimous," Ilya summed up. - Then twenty percent per brother.
   - How much will we sell it for?
   - Half a galleon for the shot," Fred shrugged, still holding his stomach.
   - It seems expensive," Ilya stretched out, suspecting that no one would buy at such a price.
   - Don't worry, Ilya," George said. - They'll sell out in a heartbeat. 
   - How are the stakes, by the way? - Ilya suddenly inquired. 
   He had a fifth in the sweepstakes, too, and eighty percent went to the Twins. The division was because Illya had the idea and the promotion, and Weasley had all the risks and everything. In general, in this case, everything was fair. 
   - There's already some...
   - ... after the holidays...
   - ... it's going uphill.
   They were quiet for a while, trying to catch their breath and calm their frayed nerves. The operation, code-named "The Boiler on the Panel," took the three marginalists and their two accomplices about an hour. Most of the time was spent laughing and resting afterwards.
   - Shall we split up? - Ilya asked.
   - Yes, you can...
   - ... Filch in second, the rest...
   - ... on duty, too, far away.
   - I've always wondered," Weasel said with a grunt, getting to his feet. - How do you know who's where in the castle?
   - You'll know a lot," Fred clapped Ilya on the right shoulder.
   - You won't sleep well," George slapped Weasel on his left.
   
   
   
   
   
   18 October 1993 England, Hovagrts
    
    
    
    
    
    
   The match schedule has undergone a major change, and while last year the first came in early November, this year it's mid-October. The reasons for the change we already knew-the Dementors and the hand of Malfoy. Which of those two extremes was more abominable, Weasel didn't know. Still, he grimaced as he made his way to the bleachers.
   - Ilya, are you sure you're coming with us? - Isabelle asked.
   Ilya, as always, walked along with his companions. Patil was spending more and more time with Seamus, but she was beginning to get tired of it. Teenagers are like that - very fickle.
   - It's not like they're playing against Slytherin," he shrugged. - I could cheer for the Gryffs, too. 
   - I'm not going to let it go like that," she said, her head shaking. - I'm not going to let Malfoy get away with this.
   - I've got something to nail him with," Weasel grinned predatory.
   A merry flock of serpentine sophomores ran past, and among them Ilya noticed the exuberant head of Astoria Greengrass. Astoria, like her sister, was unusually beautiful. Except that while Daphne was a true blonde, her sister was known as a fiery brunette. Put these two beauties side by side and you could paint a picture of Yin and Yang. They were so different in their "coloring" and identical in their stunning beauty. 
   - By the way, it's a little too quiet this year," MacDougall chuckled. 
   Ilya had long been annoyed by these giggles, but he kept a low profile so as not to offend anyone.
   - Yeah, the castle's gotten pretty boring," Lavender said in agreement.
   - I'm no jester," muttered a slightly offended Ilya. - But as of tomorrow, I guarantee a lot of fun.
   - How exciting! - Isabelle was so excited. - Tell me!
   Ilya grinned mentally. He wasn't really going to tell them that Creevey was going to finish developing the film tonight, and that tomorrow they were going to start selling the pictures underground. 
   - Hang in there and you'll find out.
   - Yuck, that's boring.
   - It's seasonal for me. I always get moody by winter.
   - How about warming you up? - She winked and wiggled her shoulder, fluttering her eyelashes.
   - I don't want to be accused of arson," Ilya countered instantly.
   It is unlikely that MacDougall was really prepared to take any action following such a transparent hint, but you must not leave things unsaid in such conversations. If it does happen, either the girl will think that you are complexed or shy, or she will make up her own unknown mind. If you ask where he knows, he will answer this - the books. Weasel has learned a lot about life in general from books. 
   The stadium loomed up ahead, but at that moment the black clouds that covered the sky finally opened their flaps and a real downpour poured down on the ground. Weasel took a long, classic umbrella out of his bag and opened it over his friends. Patil, however, snuck under exactly the same umbrella to Seamus, whose sidekick, Dean, manically stepped aside and walked alone.
   Isabelle and Lavender snuggled up to the weasel. Not so much for any intimate reasons, but just to keep from getting wet. Ridiculously, the two girls' bodies did warm Ilya, but it was more simple physics than fanciful metaphysics. Ilya did not and did not want to think about serious or not-so-serious relationships. He simply did not have time for them, and there was no desire for them. The weasel felt quite comfortable alone with his own thoughts, affairs, and plans.
   A considerable line had already gathered near the stadium at the booth. The birds probably had no idea why a huge river of black and sometimes colorful umbrella mushrooms suddenly bloomed on the ground. And the answer was quite simple - tickets. Really, you didn't think watching a Quidditch match at school was free, did you? No, of course the price was quite symbolic, only a pound and a half, but there it was nonetheless. 
   Climbing the steep, rain swollen, dirty and slippery wooden steps, Ilya found himself in the Gryffindor sector. The place was already crowded, and heavy, murky streams of typically British-smelling, freezing rain streamed down the edges of umbrellas. Many wore special water-repellent goggles over their eyes to comfortably follow the match. Others used special charms, but Ilene required neither. He could see perfectly, despite the wall of rain, as if abstracted from the slashing drops. 
   Ilya took a scarlet scarf from the hands of some do-gooder, wrapped it around him, and sat down on the skywalk, holding an umbrella over his head. Isabelle, Lavender, and whoever else had enough room to sit under the black dome. 
   However, although the stadium was literally drenched in rain, the students were still going wild, shouting counting, shouting and other vocal paraphernalia of sporting events. But then Madame Hooch showed up on the field, limboing the chest where the magic balls were encased. Two bludgers, a quaffle, and a little golden asshole - a snitch. 
   - Miss me?! - the familiar voice of the commentator blaring across the field. - Here I am, Lee Jordan, your faithful commentator! Let's make some noise!
   The stands cheered and stomped, because there was no way to clap. Ilya shouted and stomped along with everyone else. After all, the point is to watch the match live if you can't afford such joys.
   - As we know," Lee continued. - Malfoy has a boo-boo with his knob, so today against the valiant Gryffindor, the equally valiant Hufflepuff will take the field! Let's welcome our gladiators of the broom and the ball!
   There was even more cheering, shouting and stomping. It even seemed as if the stands were one howling, shouting and stomping organism, trembling under the hypnotic cries of the commentator.
   Down there, on a field that looked like one brown, flowing slurry, fourteen men emerged, among whom a ruffled black hair and shiny glasses were instantly recognizable.
   - Speaking from Gryffindor today is our captain and goalkeeper who is graduating this year - Oliver Wood! I think I've had too much to drink, because I see two single Chasers. Oh, no! It's our Twins! Oh, my God, someone stole my heart and ripped it into three pieces. Our three stunning beauties with sticks between their legs... So, the Chasers are Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet! And, of course, let's welcome our perpetual catcher - Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy!
   The crowd was buzzing and shouting. Two faculties - Ravenclaw and Gryffindor something uplifting and encouraging. Badgers - light and a little offensive, but Slytherin rushed to mix the team in general and Potter in particular with mud. But their cries were often overpowered by those of the others. 
   - On the Hufflepuff side, up in the air will be: the goalkeeper who can score you a goal with one kick across the field - Ilya Fleet! The runners-up - the lightning-quick Anthony Rickett, and, it's no secret - the stick-knowledgeable...
   - The microphone, Jordan, give me that micro...
   - I apologize for the slight interference on the line! Second Runner-up, Maxim O'Flaherty! The runners-up, the charming Heidi McAvoy, whose flight, for obvious reasons, can be watched forever. Not once missed the milk all last season - Malcolm Preece, and of course, my adored goddess - Tamsin Appleby. Love you, baby! Hands off the mic! 
   Digori was one of the most popular guys in the school, so it was no surprise that he was greeted very, very eagerly. The squeals and squeals of the female section of the stadium were especially audible. Isabelle and Lavender were cheering along with everyone else, and Weasel even ducked a little in both ears. He felt as if there were not two girls sitting next to each other, but two insistent mosquitoes. 
   But at last the first whistle blew and the fourteen took to the sky. Madam Hooch pointed her wand at the chest.
   - And here was the referee putting the balls in play! - Jordan, who had risen from his seat and put his foot on the pulpit, sounded like an army captain before a fight. - Snitch immediately disappeared in the rain and mist, and the quaffle was intercepted by Spineth!
   Alicia, brown ball in hand, dodged a well-aimed bludger and raced toward the badgers' goal. Spinet always had mad speed, but she often lost out on maneuvers, especially in the vertical.
   - Tamsin rushes in, come on sweetie, come on and oooh yes! Appleby knocks the quaffle out of Spinet's hands, but Bell picks it up in a flash. Sorry, sweetheart, but our Furies play better! 
   - Jordan, this is the last time I'm gonna...
   Katie, taking possession of the ball, ducked under the effeminate Flaherty, and was almost close to the badger rings. But she ran into Preece, who flew in just in time. There was no chance to hit the basket from such a position - Ilya knew that.
   - And Bell passes to Johnson! But the quaffle falls from the sky and McAvoy, look at those... ahem... who's gonna go first?! And, oh devil and holy macaroni! George Weasley, and don't even ask me how I identified him, mistook a quaffle for a bludger!
   Despite what Lee said, Forge deliberately slammed the bat into another ball. Weasel knew it was a technique Vulture had been practicing in training for a couple of weeks. How - connections, rumours, deduction, observation and all that. 
   Quoffle darted toward the goal, and was intercepted just inside the line by Bell, who was still in her seat. And with a slight laziness she tossed him toward the goal. 
   - What a feint! Fleet falls to the bottom left, but because of the rain, he can't see it's a twist! Bell hits the top and the score becomes 10-0 in favor of Gryffindor! It's the first goal of the season for the Lions!
   The stands exploded with shouts and applause. Traditionally, the first goal of the season was supported by the whole school. Although, as you might have guessed, this tradition was followed by everyone except the Greens. They could not afford to applaud in honor of the "enemy" faculty - fools, I will say nothing. But Ilya was busting his balls as much as he could. He loved not only playing Quidditch, but also watching this wonderful sport. These battles under the dome of the sky, at insane speeds on all planes, were far more tempting than any Mugglewolf sport with a sword. 
   - But what is it?! Oh, yes, gentlemen, our Trappers have spotted the Snitch! As Spinnet and McAvoy battle for the quaffle, Potter and Digory go for a vertical dive. They get lost in the rain, but seem to be going for a flush! Who... kh... psh... them... kha... ssh... maet...
   Jordan seemed to be having trouble with the microphone. It hissed and hissed and barely spit. Suddenly, the screams, the laughter, the screeching, the stomping in the stadium died down. It was as if they were frozen in jelly, unable to get through. The wind became much colder and even more piercing, as if it were penetrating my heart, clamping it in an icy vice. 
   Instead of the wet echo of large drops, Ilya heard the measured crackle of shattering ice flakes. Suddenly it was as if all the joy, all the celebration of the first match of the season was pulled out of the atmosphere. Floating figures in black cloaks began to appear on the edges of the stadium. Shouts, sobs, and groans were heard.
   Ilya didn't understand why it was so crowded at first, but then he realized that MacDougall and Brown were huddled against him, as if looking to his friend for protection. Except that Weasel himself was utterly helpless. He was drawn deeper and deeper into the maelstrom of fear and despair, where no corner shone with the glow of joy and happiness.
   Through the faded veil, Ilya could see the circle of Dementors swirling, funneling into the sky, toward the players. But the maelstrom, like a greedy abyss, was sucking itself in. There Ilya heard a woman's laughter, a terrible laugh, full of madness and insidious pleasure. The laughter, from which the prince pressed himself into a corner, trying to find the spear and pitchfork of the freak, while the freak on the contrary - clenched his teeth in a steel lock and scrambled in the darkness, looking for a poisoned sting, in order to shove it down the throat of who belongs to this hellish cackle.
   I don't know why, and with trembling hands I reached into his robe pocket and pulled out his lighter, almost dropping it. The darkness was approaching with the inexorability of a rushing train. And the greedy fangs of the blackness glinted like the drawn blade of an executioner's axe. 
   - Click, click," Silicon coughed.
   - "Swear..." - sounded somewhere deep in my head.
   The colors were so faded that it felt like watching a black-and-white movie. It was getting harder to breathe, and sweat trickled down my back and forehead. Isabelle shuddered and cried, and Brown bit her lip bloodily, squeezing so hard she could have broken the bones in her eye sockets.
   - Click, click," came the flint again, still not lighting the fuse.
   - "I swear..."  - and then another attack of that laughter. 
   - Click," the flint coughed one last time, and the flame of the lighter soared a good twenty centimeters upward. Ilya gazed into the red strands of orange dancing, and the fear receded. The prince turned his shoulders and reached for the fire, as if wanting to draw his strongest weapon from the dance of chaos.
   - "I lied - Crucio," Ilya heard as if through a veil, and the feeling of despair and fear began to slowly creep away.
   It, an oppressive, sticky sense of doom, like the worst, the darkest darkness, shivered and cringed, retreating before the bright, orange fire. For an instant the flame was as high as Ilya's face, but even that split second was enough to bring the young man to his senses, and the lighter was glowing with the usual flame. 
   And Prynora pressed the flame harder and harder against his chest, as if he knew that if he moved his hand a millimeter to the side, the darkness and the cold of the Dementors would bind him in rusty chains. Darkness and awkwardness still reigned around him, but within Ilya a fiery flower blossomed, taking root in the young man and giving him the sensation of fire running through his veins. It was a welcome and long-awaited sensation that only came when Ilya touched the strings of his guitar with his fingers. 
   Ilya looked up and saw that the Dementors wanted to swim toward him, stretching their arms, covered in deadly scabs, but they couldn't. They stared at the tiny light, afraid of it, and swam away, only to turn and stare greedily into Ilya's bright blue eyes.
   There was a scream of horror from the stadium, and literally everyone's eyes fell on the broken doll, falling from the black heavens. There was a white glow, and Ilya recognized the doll as the figure of Potter, who appeared to be unconscious. It was only a couple of meters to the ground when everything around him shook with unimaginable magical power. Hair stood up on every part of his body where it grew, his breath snapped, and his thoughts tangled in themselves. 
   Ilya glanced at the faculty podium and saw Dumbledore holding his wand bare. Then he looked across the field and saw Potter hovering in midair. But besides the man never reached the ground, he froze and breathed, hundreds of thousands of water droplets. Then all at once they fell. And Ilya realized that sometimes a sniper rifle could not match the force of a nuclear explosion. It was the most powerful Leviossa anyone had ever seen. Dumbledore's magic was comparable only to the power of a titan descended from his mansions.
   The Great Light Mage's lips quirked, his wand smudged in a sweep, and then everything was drowned in silver light. An enormous phoenix, woven with silver threads, spread its wings over the field. The phoenix was so big that it domed the stadium, resembling the mythical bird Rukh. 
   The Dementors shrieked and wailed as they flew away from this moon that had fallen to the ground, in the shape of a bird. The magical phoenix opened its beak and let out a low trill that sent a wave of magic so iridescent and luminous that the students' faces were transformed. The paths of tears dried, the shroud of fear disappeared from their eyes, and it seemed as if even the dark heavens had stopped their flood and opened their blinders, letting the life-giving powers of the sun to the earth. 
   In just an instant, Albus Dumbledore transformed the place, completely obliterating all the darkness and gloom that had accumulated here since the arrival of, as Muggle fantasy writers would say, the undead. And with a pop the phoenix split into thousands of feathers, tumbling and swirling in the cherry. Those Dementors who hadn't yet managed to get away fell beneath them and squealed in the infernal pain that the darkness was inflicting on the true, genuine light. Soon all was quiet and silent. People poured out onto the field, rushing to make their way to Harry. Isabelle and Lavender ran off, too. And the rest of the Scarlet Clan were on their way to see their friend and hero. 
   Ilya was alone, all alone in a completely empty sector. His umbrella was lying in a stream of brown, wet mud, trampled and broken, tattered and faded. Ilya rose from his seat, wobbled, but did not fall - grabbed the bench a tier higher, and then walked away. And only the light of the lighter, so simple, small and unsightly, was the only companion on the way from the stadium to the Forest. Only there, under the shadow of the crowns, among the eternal laughter of the wind in the leaves and grass, among the rustling of furry paws, weasel could feel himself a part of something bigger, something brighter than the space called - Ilya of Scary Square. Ilya hated being alone...
   
   
   
   
   
   October 21, 1993 England, Hovagrts
   
   
   
   
   After the Dementor incident, the stakes were skyrocketing. Literally everyone was eager to bet money on one end of Potter or the other. Literally the phrase. All the vultures, as one, were betting that Goggles would make it. The others were eagerly throwing in bronze, silver, and sometimes even gold for the position - "He'll die. 
   The estimated profit, if Potter survived, would be about seventy galleons. If he did die, the loss would be almost a thousand gold pieces. Why would that be? It is too long and tedious to explain the economics of sweepstakes and the profits of those who arrange it. But one-fifth of seven tens of gold was also not a bad help for an orphan from an orphanage. 
   Not to mention the pictures. Oh, yes, this enterprise was really going to make a fortune. Already on the first day of underground sales, Ilya counted his own proceeds at almost a third of a galleon. And the Twins didn't think to stop there. They brought up a bartender in the "Boar's Head", who began to sell dirt for his own money. Some shrewd guy named Nuffer (I think his name was Mundungus Fletcher) got involved, and for his fee, he wanted to distribute the photos down Koskoy and Lutnoe Alley. As a result, in two days Ilya's personal profit reached the mark of almost a whole gold. The market theory was that sales would peak in the second month, so Ilya estimated that by the end of the year he would have enough money to buy himself a used car. 
   Didn't you know that? Ilya was a hardcore speed freak, a car freak, and a chopper freak. That Slavic priest had an old broken-down chopper in the barn behind the church, a Harley of a bearded year, but with a workshop plaque - a steel horse straight from America. The Russian or Ukrainian (you can't tell without a hundred grams of the famous drink) the theologian was better at metal than the scripture, and Ilya and Rosie, who shared his love, sometimes disappeared for long periods of time in that shed to work with Harley and broken-down Chevrolet, which could only be called sporty if you turn back time fifteen years. 
   And now, perhaps, Ilya will save up the money for his machine, and he will have a sports broom and his own car. It is not a paradise for yesterday's bum from the most dreary and criminal area of not only London, but the whole of Foggy Albion.
   - What's that under your desk? - Suddenly Snape barked in my ear.
   - Legs, sir," answered Ilya, whose voice, because of the respirator, sounded somewhat strange.
   With a wave of his wand, the potter pulled the student aside and examined everything carefully. Then he hissed something and hissed:
   - Keep your eyes peeled, Mr. Ilya.
   Ilya, if he had his way, would have poured this very potion into the toilet, where, in Ilya's opinion, it belonged. But there was nothing to do, so I had to saw another abomination and slowly pour it into the cauldron, at the same time adding to the flame. Today was an independent job and everyone stood on their own. On the table, apart from the abominations, there was one phial, which had to be filled with "moonshine". In fact, it was on this phial that your mark would be emblazoned afterwards. Weasel, as always, was aimed exclusively at "P". But the process of "chemistry" was even more difficult for him than Transfiguration, so the boy's efforts were worthy of all admiration for such a firm will. 
   And as you can imagine. As soon as the pictures appeared in the castle walls, the owner of the image depicted on them found out about it. He simply couldn't help but find out, because Gemini and Ilya had slipped the pictures under his door late that night. Snape had been moping around ever since, and he'd been brutal ever since. He paced the entire castle, circling the dungeons a mile away, where Mr. Bat reigned. Ilya just grunted and strode regally past the Bastard.
   After all, we know perfectly well that Ilya does not forget debts, neither those of others, nor, more importantly, his own. And Severus-give-him-a-shampoo-Snape owed his student a lot. So Illya had paid it back. Now it was McGee's turn, who was on the counter for that fluffy trick. 
   - Let's turn in our work! - Snape yelled, taking a seat at the table.
   Ilya filled the vial and blew it off with a show of charms, maneuvering his way around the lined line. Everyone turned to the guy who had already gathered for the exit and looked at him with obvious anger. After all, Illyena had to stand in line and stuff. But, as they say, include your head sometimes and do not forget that you're fucking mages, and the shelf can not only pick in the known places. 
   
   
   
   Weasel, wasting no time, directed his footsteps to the floor with the teachers' offices. Today, that day, was scheduled for another "class" with Professor Flitwick. As Ilya moved up the ancient stone steps, which were safely hidden in all corners of the castle, he thought about the fact that today he would probably ruin his relationship with the goblin for some part, but it was impossible otherwise. 
   Ilya did not tolerate weakness in people, he did not tolerate whiners, brats, losers, and those who were ready to cry on the shoulder of their neighbors and the casual. Ilya was sure that all that you need to say this sensual and acute, you can say to the mirror, and then throw away, because neither you nor the world, weakness was not needed. Weakness is like a sentence - if you show it (weakness) and all, you'll be eaten, crumpled up and take away all that can be taken away, and then even obliged to give throughout life. That was the law of Scary Square and St. Frederick's, and that was the law of what people call "humane and civilized" society.
   Ilya did not tolerate weakness, and all these days he could not tolerate himself. After all, he had let himself go, he had failed to deal with the problem, he had let someone else decide things for him. Yeah, maybe half a thousand other students couldn't handle the Dementors, but Illya didn't care about them. What did he care what others could and couldn't do, if he couldn't do it himself. How could he not tolerate the likes of Potter the sniveling, Malfoy the weak-assed, Granger the Dangerous, Ron the...condom, if he found himself the same way. Just a whiny kid looking for protection from someone strong.
   No, Ilya hated himself for this epichod. For succumbing to such a trifle as fear, for allowing himself to plunge into something as insignificant as despair. For betraying everything that he considered the most important thing in life - the ability to always keep his tail between his legs. It turns out that Ilya showed himself not only weak, but also a traitor. And there was simply nowhere lower to fall, it could not go any lower. And something had to be done about it. He might have to go through the valley of the shadow of death again, but not a soul in this godforsaken world would be able to say that Ilya the Hippogriff-Ilya the wizard of Skary Square was nothing more than a weakling, a traitor, and a scoundrel. No, that will never happen.
   Weasel took the key to Flitwick's private office out of his pocket and twisted it in the keyhole. Cheerfully, as always, the tongue clicked and with a creak the door unlocked. The professor wasn't in the spacious, bright room; he was waiting for the Slytherin down there.
   As he passed by the guitar, Ilya froze for a moment, but then walked decisively to the knight's armor and turned the hilt of his sword. The knight bowed as if alive, as usual, and stepped aside, revealing behind him a blackening passage and a steep spiral staircase.
   Ilya took a step forward, leaving his Babe behind him. No, he couldn't allow those strings to be touched by the fingers of the lowlife he'd turned into in just a couple of days. What kind of music could he play? Only the kind that would make all the gods of music turn their backs on him and never come back again. No, he had no right to touch the guitar.
   Weasel descended the stairs and found himself in a corridor filled with all sorts of doors that literally glowed with the number of protective and locking charms on them. But the Slytherin's path lay further, to the very last and largest of the doors.
   With each step weasel was imbued with the atmosphere of this part of the castle. An atmosphere of determination, of courage, of not accepting any laws or limits. All that was important and sacred to the young man, and all that he had betrayed because of his own weakness. But all that Ilya intended to reclaim for himself. And then to forget this episode as he had forgotten all the filth, lies, deceit, evil, blackness, despair, and other things that were abundant in the Scary Square orphan. 
   "Never remember evil!" - a motto from one of Ilya's favorite books, had long ago become his motto, too. He knew that life was so short and beautiful that it would be the height of idiocy to remember darkness. And it was certainly not the way to nurture it in himself, to complain that this was the way to rise above others. No, that was the way of someone else, but not of Ilya Ilya.
   The doors of the hall swung open and Ilya stepped under the vault, where the magic shrouds summoned by the two-time European Duel Champion were already swirling. Flitwick stood on the platform, twirling his wand in his fingers. He was expecting a Slytherin, and pride splashed in his eyes. And like a sharp, poisonous sting, that pride plunged into Ilya's heart. No, he was not worthy of the praise, the joy that radiated from the enchantment master's eyes after the summer. 
   For then, after the first "class" of the year, Flitwick had said that Ilya had finally taken off. That for the first time in a year and a half, he had begun not to defend himself, hoping to resist the onslaught of a superior opponent, but to attack - wanting to defeat that very enemy. The desire to win, that was what was central to the flight. 
   - Let's begin, Ilya," the tip of Filius's wand glowed, but the enchantment never snapped into action.
   - Professor," said Ilya in an alien, husky, cracked voice, and shrunk in size. 
   His bright eyes suddenly faded, and even his very beauty turned to some inner ugliness. This did not escape the tenacious gaze of a small almost-man, with a huge light heart. 
   - What's wrong with you, Ilya? Are you sick?
   Ilya shook his head, then said:
   - I'm sorry, Professor, but I have to break our agreement...
   - Go on.
   - ? ... ? ... I... want to ask you to teach me a spell. A spell that will help me deal with the Dementors!
   Flitwick, who had tensed a moment ago after that phrase, suddenly relaxed and walked over to Ilya. He clapped the Slytherin on the back and sat down on the edge of the platform. With childlike directness and nonchalance, for some part the goblin began to wiggle his feet in the air.
   - Have a seat, Ilya.
   Weasel shuddered, but sat down next to him, very close. From the outside, if you didn't know better, you'd think a father was talking to his son, or a grandfather to his grandson. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that at all. Or maybe it was, but Ilya didn't know who "father" was, only what the word was.
   - I cannot teach you that," said Flitwick, sighing heavily, and meeting the Slytherin's nearly dead eyes, he added immediately. - "But not because I don't want to! I would give a lot to give you that knowledge. But I don't have it myself, you see.
   - But...
   - Don't even try Ilya, these are too great secrets of magic that I am in a hurry to reveal to you. Ilya, you didn't manage to master either occlusion, did you? And that is why you wore first a bandana of insulating cloth, and then this hat, with a hem of the same material?
   - Yes," the young man admitted mournfully.
   - And that's not surprising," the professor smiled warmly. - I can quite understand you. See these earrings? They're not a whim of mine, not a tribute to goblin tradition. They're amulets to protect my thoughts. I can't master the science of mind protection, either.
   - It's... it's... it's kind of...
   - Shocking?
   - Exactly.
   Flitwick laughed.
   - But Professor, what does occlusion have to do with my request?
   - Now, now, I can explain...ah...ah," Flitwick hissed in another coughing fit, but held up his hand to indicate that he was all right. When the fit was over, the old man said. - "This cold... You see Ilya. The patronus spell, which is what will help you when you encounter a Dementor, is a High Magic spell. And ninety-nine percent of High Magic is the symbiosis of one branch of magic and the most ancient and profound one - Mental Magic.
   - I read something about her... - I've read something about her.
   - Of course you have. After all, it was the basis of all current magical science! It is the very foundation of magic. It is the basis of magic, which nature had deprived me and, sadder still, you of. You see, we have no ability for mental magic. 
   - I still don't understand.
   - No wonder," Flitwick snorted. - Imagine you need to animate the stone statues. Where would you get the intelligence for them to be able to distinguish between allies and enemies? Where would you get the skills to hold weapons for them? Where will you get everything else for them? Only in the mind - in your mind, Ilya. And part of that mind you will for a time, by magic, put into an animated sculpture, endowing it with some of your own, as well as your own-utrilized, qualities. It is the same with all Higher Magic, it always has a part of your "I". And a Patronus, in addition, is its incarnation. The Patronus is not only the Highest Light Magic, but also the apogee, the very essence of the Mental. But you and I know that until you try it, you won't know. So here's the thing Ilya. Imagine your brightest, happiest memory, then make such waves and say: ExpectoPatronum!
   And Ilya closed his eyes. It wasn't worth the trouble to get that happiest memory. It was not worth the trouble to get them two, five, twenty, almost a hundred. Ilya, who left no evil or darkness in his soul, always lived in the light and in the light. Images of his friends were replaced by pictures of Egypt, and then childhood, and the Forest, and the broom, and Hogwarts, and thousands more. Ilya filled his whole self with a sense of infinite joy, fun, happiness, and life. 
   He and Flitwick didn't know it, but the ghosts in the vicinity were howling in pain and horror and scurrying away. The portraits of the once-living humans glowed, and the humans darted away. They did not know that the torches in the corridor behind the doors suddenly flashed like stars. They did not know that all the fire in the castle and next to it danced, as if welcoming someone whom they had been waiting for so long, someone whom they no longer hoped to see in this world, someone dear, close to them. 
   - ExpectoPatronus!" said the young man.
   But nothing happened. The tip of the wand blinked, and that was it.
   - That's what I had to prove," Flitwick sighed. - Any wizard, even the most unlucky one, would have a faint silvery cloud projecting his self from his wand. But you and I can't even do that.
   - Professor," Ilya said again, tapping himself on the chin. - It turns out that by using Higher Magic, a person separates a piece of the mind...
   - Only for a while, then it comes back. The ancient sages even used it to expand the boundaries of their perception. However, I know a magician who still dabbles in it. He's also the headmaster of a school you know.
   - Um...
   - But... you seem to be thinking about something else.
   - Avada Kedavra sir. I understand how it works.
   Flitwick smiled and nodded his head, offering to continue:
   - After all, it separates the soul from the body, but how can you separate Yin from Yang? The soul from the body? Only if you cheat the universe. It seems that the principle of symbiosis works here. The magician takes a particle, a small particle of his soul, and attaches it to the soul of the incanted. But that particle is already dead and must go on, and the power of the pull is so great that it takes away both the particle and the whole soul. This spell, so powerful and dangerous, is essentially a simple deception.
   - Bravo, Ilya. Many people need hours of lectures and hundreds of sentences of complex explanations to understand it. 
   - But that knowledge will not help me with my question," Weasel grimaced.
   - But perhaps another will help," the professor winked. - Ilya, magic never gives anything without taking something in return. But this law works in the opposite sense, too. I have been observing your sorcery for a long time, Ilya, and I repent, I know what your talent is, what your payment is, for your lack of abilities in Mental Magic.
   Flitwick waved his hand and a vase appeared out of thin air on the platform. A beautiful, porcelain vase.
   - Get her in the air.
   - Win...
   - No, no. No words. Lift her into the air non-verbally Ilya.
   - But....
   - You won't know until you try it.
   Ilya looked at the professor with skepticism, and then mentally said the right formula with a wave of his wand. A moment and the vase was floating in the air. Ilya's mouth opened slightly, and his eyes opened like windows in the morning. It was so easy, so simple, not at all like they write in textbooks.
   - You will never master High Magic and Mental Magic, but your talent is non-slave spells. Perhaps something else. Magic is always fair and takes and gives - equally. 
   Filius waved his wand again, and the vase disappeared. And the young man was transformed, handsome again, his eyes shining like jewels in the sunlight. The weasel grew taller, his shoulders and back straightened.
   - Professor, I... I...
   - You have to run - get to work. Go ahead, Ilya, fly in your own stream and never look down again. The earth is not for us.
   The young man nodded, jumped off the platform and ran for the door. But he stopped, turned, and uttered a "ritual phrase:
   - Thank you, Professor.
   And heard the "ritualistic response."
   - You're welcome, Ilya. Absolutely nothing.
   Weasel literally flew out the doors, and they slammed shut behind the boy's back with a noise. Ilya ran for the stairs before he saw Flitwick, sitting on the platform, coughing again.
   
   
   
   
   October 30, 1993 England Hogwarts
    
    
 
    Ilya set the point and stretched sweetly. Everything was ready. He had literally been in his den day and night for the past nine days. He'd even missed a few classes by taking Pomfrey's sick leave. But still, everything was ready. Yes, his first spell. The very first one. The one he hadn't learned in class, the one he hadn't found in a textbook, the one he'd made himself from start to finish. Twelve levels, forty-one operations, nine non-verbal constructs, two Junior and three Senior runes (it took him several hundred hours and a couple of liters of blood from his nose and ears to cram the runes), and two verbal constructs, and the spell was finished. 
   All in all it took a gigantic number of hours to work, considering that the idea originated so long ago. But still - Ilya pulled it off. He took all his intelligence, courage, and faith, and melted something new out of them, something the world had never seen before. It was an amazing feeling to know that you could create something. To create something out of nothing.
   Ilya was sitting among a pile of scribbled parchment, among the donated papers, a typewriter, and dozens of empty ink jars. And in his diary there was only a two-page entry, with movements and a formula, both verbal and non-verbal. 
   Still, something was keeping Illya from venturing into the woods to try out his creation. That something was a letter yellowed with old age. The letter, a copy of which Ilya had inadvertently summoned from his Berloga. Apparently the original lay somewhere in the immense library or in the bowels of the castle. What interested the lad in the message was only the inscription, "To the Prophet, for England.
   Ilya had never opened another man's mail, but he was English, so this letter was for him, too. Weasel stretched himself sweetly, yawned, and took the envelope in his hands. Now that his business was done, he could afford a little diversion. 
   With a crunch the wax seal split open, and a thin sheet of paper of a message descended into Illyes' lap.
   
   
   
   "I know that this letter will never be published, it will never even reach the shores of the country to which I have caused so much evil. Perhaps it is the right thing to do. Evil should not stand beside good, and I have been evil. For a short time, a couple of years, but how many terrible things I managed to do in those sad days. How many orphans I've left behind, how many widows, how many fathers, how many children I've outlived... no, it's too much for a human to handle, well, let's thank magic that I'm not a human. 
   This letter will never be published, so I can proudly say - I'm not human. And so all the curses you sprinkle on my head at night can rightly begin with, "You vile wretch," though I know you say it anyway, you can't help saying, what I did was inhuman, was horrible...
   However, if you're wondering who I am, ask your government or the valiant Aurors. They know, they always have.
   You may ask why I'm writing. I don't know. My heart is asleep in another room, and there's only a bottle of whiskey on the table, not even ice for a glass... So I'm writing. I can't not write. It is silly and low to ask for forgiveness, and even more so to hope that you will forgive me, but still I ask, from my heart, from my soul, with sincerity unknown to me until now, I ask forgiveness for what I have done.
   I wish I could say, the devil, how I wish I could say that it wasn't all of my will, but it wasn't. It was all part of me, all the hatred, all the rage toward the mages, it wasn't from whoever you call Vol-de-Mort-that he didn't create it in my soul, it was always there, and I only gave an outlet. And yet I apologize. For the blood, for the tears, for the flames that have not warmed you, but burned you to ashes, to the ground. And for the ashes, too, I ask forgiveness.
   Oh, my heart is awake, it's in labor. Here I have to interrupt and write one last time - forgive me. 
   Well, I hope this washes my hands a little bit. You can't hold children with bloody hands. I know that.
   Faustus Liebflem."
   
   
   
   
   Ilya reread the letter a few more times, and then folded it several times and put it away in the edge of the table. It was a pity it could not be taken out of the room, but weasel decided that he would find the original. And when he found it, he would hide it to reflect on the text later. Probably in a couple of years, when the time of mysteries comes. Because this year is a year free of mysteries and mysteries.
   Weasel gathered his things, ran his fingers through the brim of his hat, and moved toward the dungeons. There he would leave everything superfluous behind and continue on his way - to the edge of the territory, where he, having fought the Dementors, would reclaim himself.
 

Chapter 26
   October 30, 1993, England, the Enchanted Forest
    
    
    
    
    
   Ilya lit a cigarette, took a drag, and set the magic phone on the ground. Fighting Dementors without music was like Thanksgiving without turkey - not kosher. Ilya adjusted his hat and began squatting with his arms outstretched forward. After that he did a few bends at his sides, and then began to stretch out his arms, crunching all his vertebrae.
   And around them swayed dark, as if rotted trees. This corner of the forest, the darkest place, where the most horrible creatures lived, weasel had only been there once. According to Hogwarts lore no wizard ever found his way into this part of the forest alive. But weasel had a gut feeling that he had to stay on the path, and he stayed there.
   Ilya had seen such horrible creatures that his heart was ready to freeze and jump out of his chest. Seen such horrors as could only be found at the bottom of witchcraft, witchcraft dark, grim. But still, as long as Ilya stood on the path, these monsters and unimaginable creatures did not touch him. In two and a half years, Ilya had explored the entire forest, even been to the kentar camp, but he never returned here. Not until he heard that this was where the Dementors were huddled. Where else would they be, though.
   As Ilya warmed up, smoking a cigarette at the same time, the air around him grew thicker and stinkier. The dew on the black, rotted, rotten grass began to freeze, covering everything around it with a thin crust of frost. My heart was in a dangerous, steel vice. An alarm bell sounded in my temples.
   Finally Ilya straightened up and looked up at the sky. Here it was not visible, instead only the black crowns, like the dome of a shrinking abyss. Among the stench and decay was heard the light, almost glossy rustling of grave shrouds. Lusciously tender notes of dead agony and howling ghosts touched the ear. A howl was heard in the distance, the howl of a creature so terrible and deadly that its mere presence would send you over the edge. But this creature, too, frightened those who were coming for their prey.
   Dementors flew like moths to a light in the night. To them, the young wizard was like a speck of life in the earth, ruled only by the merciless laughter of Death.
   - What shall I put on? - Ilya thoughtfully stretched out, holding two cassettes in his hands.
   One was AC/DC "High way to hell" from '79, the other was AC/DC "TnT" from '84. At last Ilya put the second cassette into the machine with determination. He pressed the play button and the first notes of the immortal hit flashed through the dark forest.
   Dementors swirled around, and Weasel felt himself slowly melting into the darkness. But he kept afloat in that pool of blackest oil, so lingering, so alluring. Brian Johnson's vocal outbursts flew through the forest, and even the trees seemed to crackle to the beat of the track.
   - Well, who wants a commissioner's body? - Ilya smirked, sending his cigarette flying in a distant flight toward the nearest raincoat.
   A cold cloud burst from Weasel's mouth, crumbling in a flash of fine snow dust.
   - Don't be shy, gentlemen, come up one by one, cloak in the hollow.
   It was as if the Dementors had been waiting for this invitation and immediately lied in rapid flight. Standing on the edge of the abyss of his own consciousness, the weasel raised his red, flaming wand. It flickered and swirled, conjuring up impossible, intricate figures and symbols. And mentally, silently, the weasel recited the lines of his spell. And with each new syllable, with each new word, the wand ignited like a campfire in the silence of the night.
   Finally the last formula sounded, and the wand was ready to represent the Elder Rune, binding the verbal and non-verbal forms together.
   - Welcome to hell, creatures," Ilya smiled dangerously, quite beastly, and said:
   - IgnisBestia: Papilios!
   The hand completed the rune, and at the same instant a torrent of flame burst from the depths of Weasel's soul to the scarlet wand. It mingled with the magic, beating like a faint spring, and swirled her around in a frantic swing. So fast that she couldn't tell one from the other.
   My eyes were stabbed by the flash of bright, red flames bursting from the tip of the blazing tree. A huge, surreally large cloud of flame swirled among the forest, scorching everything that could be scorched. Burning rotten grass to the ground, turning ancient trees to ashes, heating the air to such a degree that skin would burst like an inflated balloon, hair would burn like dry straw. But Ilya stood amidst this chaos of fire as if nothing was happening. Tongues of flame touched his neck and face, but they left no trace, no burning, but as if they were glossing and caressing him like a long bored dog.
   The Dementors howled and swam away, trying to hide in the darkness. But the cloud wouldn't let them do that. It suddenly shrank to a point, narrowed, becoming so dense that it could be weighed on a scale, and then exploded a moment later. But it didn't disappear in a bright flash, it split into dozens, hundreds, thousands of little balls. They began to stretch, to change, and soon took the form of the creatures that Ilya had most trouble with in transfiguration.
   The dark woods were swirling with a myriad of fiery swarms, ready to strike at Ilya's gesture alone. And he didn't keep his creation waiting. Ilya waved his wand, and with that swing, the disparate fire-butterflies joined together in a single stream and rushed toward the Dementors.
   The dark cloaked figures shrieked and screeched and tried to separate, but they didn't stand a chance. Weasel swung once more, like a conductor before an orchestra, and a long plume of mahouts separated from the stream, lassoing around several of the mortals who tried to escape with their escape.
   These whips of butterflies woven from the fire dragged the fugitives into a group of a dozen more Dementors. They howled their low, ear-splitting howls and tried to get out of the forming ball of flaming mahouts. But they couldn't even touch the magic. One touch of a scab-covered hand on those fluttering creatures and the dead man's paw would show terrible, black burns, and at times the flesh would erupt, revealing yellow bone.
   Soon the dungeon of flames was formed, imprisoning a dozen cloaks. Weasel kept twirling his wand, and the butterflies fluttered in time with these movements. Their wings touched the trees, leaving not burns but long, deep scalpel cuts on them. But when their bodies pressed against the bark, they left behind them only blazing flames and black, charred patches.
   Ilya froze, as if waiting for something, and then, as the last lines of the hit sounded through the forest, uttered:
   - The final chord.
   With those words, he raised his wand to the sky, and the swallows fluttered their wings furiously. As the wand whistled down to the ground, the first of Ilya's Flaming Beasts swooped in to attack.
   A new howl swept through the clearing, not scary, not frightening, but pitiful. The Dementors tried to escape, to fly away, but they didn't stand a chance. The Machaons tore them to rags, and burned them like bursting fuel. There was a squeal and a squeak and a crackle of flame, and the rampaging spell was finishing its work. The burning scraps of ancient cloaks and smoking chunks of flesh fell to the ground. In a few seconds, it was over.
   Ilya took out another cigarette and twitched the stick lightly. One of the swallows flew up and landed on the cigarette. It went up in smoke and Ilya took in the fragrant smoke with pleasure. He covered his eyes and released his charms. Butterflies began to decay, and soon the gloom settled on the clearing again, and the only reminders of the recent battle were islands of flame, black, scorched circles, and the smell of burning in the air.
   Pronira listened to his senses and realized that he was capable of summoning these particular Flaming Beasts seven, or even nine more times. The other Beasts were not ready yet, but Pronyrrha knew for sure that by the end of the year he would finish them as well.
   - Heh," Ilya said with a chuckle, shaking off the ashes. - I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I've given you the rotation, and the axis of the rotation is my penis.
   Ilya, with his wand at the ready, stepped resolutely off the path and approached the tree. Magically and physically he was not the least bit tired, but mentally it was not very easy. That's why Weasel, after knocking out his magic phone, slowly slid down the trunk to the hot ground. He tucked his right leg in, and exhaled several rings of smoke, sending them toward the burnt dark crone.
   - That's what I understand," Ilya chuckled nervously. - That's a fight. It's not like shoving a stick up a troll's nose.
   - Woof!
   Ilya shuddered and pointed his wand sharply in the direction of the dog's barking. I don't know what kind of creature could be in these cursed places. But there, among the bushes, was an ordinary dog. Except it was too big and too black. I could mistake him for a Grim.
   - I see I had an audience," the boy snorted and beckoned the animal over. - Come here, buddy, it's more fun with two people.
   The dog tilted his head sideways as if pondering, but then moved forward. When he stepped into the light, Weasel whistled. The dog was clearly a war dog. All disheveled, lean, even thin, dirty, obviously tired.
   - After the fight, too? - Weasel asked, scratching the dog's thick fur.
   He stared into Ilya's face at first, then turned his muzzle sharply toward the faculty patch. The dog recoiled and bellowed loudly. Ilya was shocked. To his memory, this was the first animal that had ever decided to snarl at a young man. However, Ilya immediately realized that the dog might growl not at him but at the snake depicted on the coat of arms.
   - What, you don't like snakes? I don't either, although I did have a snake friend, but still. Funny, studying in a department whose crest is not your most pleasant creature. And if only that, then the whole faculty treat you as you treat their crest.
   After this speech, the dog stopped growling, bowed his head sideways again, and then returned to the young man. He, with his grimy paw, smudged the faculty patch, then barked as if laughing, and settled down beside him.
   - Now that's original," Ilya said respectfully, peering at the right side of the robe. - Shall we get acquainted? My name is Ilya Ilyaom, my nickname is Weasel. And what's yours?
   The dog lifted his right ear and twitched his tail.
   - Yeah, stupid question. All right, you'll be... - Ilya thought about it. - Okay, you be Orange.
   The dog snorted.
   - I can't call you Chernysh. That's too corny. So get used to it-- Orange. Maybe I'll paint you that color later. Ron tried to paint his rat, but it didn't fucking work.
   The dog, nicknamed Orange, growled again at the word "rat".
   - What, you don't like rats either? Can't blame you for that, though," Weasel finished his cigarette and burnt the cigarette, pulling out a second one. - Do you want one? Though dogs don't smoke, but I reckon you'd like one. I don't want to be ranked as the Antichrist by Green-Piss," Proudfoot said.
   Weasel gasped again, the dog wagging his tail.
   - You're a strange animal. You growl at me, you smell weird... Anyway, it's a mystery-free year. With Potter and his crew, you could pass detective school early.
   Orange pricked up his ears and moved a little closer.
   - What, you've heard of Harry Potter, too? - Ilya grinned, ruffling the animal's hair. - Almost everyone in England has heard of him. But when I talked to people in other countries, they knew next to nothing about the Dark Lord or Scar Boy. Like there was a civil war and everything.
   The dog snorted again and laid his head in the young man's lap.
   - Sorry, no food. I haven't eaten since this morning. I did a good job on those hoodlums, though.
   Orange barked loudly and poked the guy in the chest.
   - That's what I'm saying. Don't tell anybody I pissed them off, okay? I'm already being treated like a juvenile delinquent, and now I'm getting wet... Besides, what the fuck kind of juvenile gangster am I? I'm just an ordinary gangster. A musician too, but that's another story.
   The dog snorted as if he wanted to laugh, and Ilya smiled at the joke he'd made on himself.
   - Oh, that's my life, isn't it? The first spell was successfully cast, but there was no one to celebrate with. After serving time with the Russians, drinking with the elders seems to me like an easy party in a nursing home. And there's no vodka to be found here. Oh, boy.
   Orange snorted and wagged his tail as if to encourage him.
   - I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight. I would have been taken to the ministry and tortured for example how I killed those cloaks. Because according to the laws of magic, you can't kill them. I would have opened their eyes to the truth by getting them to read the Ancient Records and the manuscripts from the Library of Alexandria, but they all had the same idea that Dementors were created to fight the Fae, and the only ones who could kill them.
   The dog froze and even became more attentive.
   - And what does that make us? That I'm Fae? But they died out in the middle of the Morgana-LaFay junta's battle against Comrade Merlin and his majesty Arthur Pendragon.
   The weasel exhaled a few puffs of smoke again, then lit a third cigarette.
   - Okay, Orange. Today is a day off from being free from mystery. I got an idea. I don't think I'm human, tail.
   The dog barked and snarled.
   - Laugh it up, flea-bitten. But the facts speak for themselves. One of my parents was probably not of the human race. I mean, look at my flame-beast charms. You know what it's all about? It's just some non-verbal "P" crap on Toad Charms! How many Senior Runes are there? The hardest Beast has five, five fucking things! And I looked it up... the most versed in the runes knows a maximum of seven, and can use no more than two, or even one. I learn them like a schoolboy learns poetry, and they're easy to use, too.
   The dog froze again and even turned toward the young man, flashing his overly intelligent, gray eyes.
   - Well, bro, that's some bullshit going on. I'm at the very minimum of my strength to barely make it through high school, but with the flame charms, I could be a seventh-year student right now! It's a paradox, my friend. The weakest, strongest in the most difficult spells. Another paradox is that one who can't master Mental Magic has no difficulty with non-verbal magic. This is all paradoxes, but the Elder Runes don't fit into them. It's like Professor Bubbling said, "too complicated for the human mind." So it's fine for the non-human mind. So it turns out, Orange, that I'm not human. Well, not half human.
   Tailed pressed his head against his knee, showing that he was sympathetic.
   - Oh, don't do that. I don't like pity. None of us like it... You know, it's funny, though, I mean, I've got spells that no one else on earth could ever master. And the best part is, I invented them myself. You'd understand, because you never had anything of your own. And others won't understand... But we don't need them to understand, do we?
   The dog barked in agreement.
   - All right, tail, I've been talking to you, and I've got a concert to give in the Vulture Lounge... Didn't I tell you? You just fell into the lap of the future King of Rock! So you can brag amongst your own kind. Yeah, well, if you're particularly hungry, you're three hours away. There's a rabbit hill in a couple of miles. If you're not a sucker, you can catch your dinner. So long, Orange.
   With these words Ilya jumped up, ruffled the dog's stiff fur one last time, lifted the magic phone on his shoulder and set off, whistling the immortal tune. The strange dog lounged in the clearing for a while longer, and then turned around exactly three hours and rushed in the indicated direction.
   
   
   
   
   October 31, 1993 England, Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
   In a couple of minutes dinner was about to start, and Ilya was still sitting in his den. In front of him, on the table, was a list of the essentials of the evening.
   - Knife," Ilya read out and checked his pocket. - Got it.
   - Smoke bomb," Weasel continued and checked the other, "In stock.
   - Self-shooter," Ilya turned down his pant leg and found a tool attached to his shin there. - It's fully operational.
   - Wand," Ilya instantly snatched his faithful battle buddy from his back pocket. - Always with you.
   - Dry rations in case of evacuation, - in the bag there was a necessary torque bag with the most necessary things. - It was prepared in advance.
   - A hundred pounds and five galleons of NZ," Weasel rummaged through his pockets, his bag, but couldn't find what he was looking for. - Had he forgotten... Or had someone stolen...
   Ilya continued his search, and soon came across a stack of gold coins and a snap of banknotes. The money went into the inside pockets of the vest in a jiffy.
   - I declare myself ready for another Halloween," Ilya called out to himself in the mirror and headed out.
   Given the experience of previous years, this year Ilya decided to approach the problem more thoroughly. Living in the same castle with Potter, you can not be sure that "31st, the tenth" will not happen some kavabunga. For example, there will be a global flood and you will be crushed by the fallen elephant monument, or suddenly some laboratory will explode and the world will be covered by the zombie apocalypse. In general, every Halloween some heresy was bound to happen, and very dangerous for your own life. So you should have been prepared.
   Ilya carefully studied the evacuation plans, the maps of Hogsmeade, read the special literature, and considered himself ready for any trouble. In general, the easiest solution was to quietly remove Ochkarik, so he did not poison people's lives, but Ilya did not want to spend more than a minute in prison. So he had to twist and turn around, in order to keep his own skin intact.
   After climbing down the stairs, which again attempted to finish the young man off, Ilya found himself at the door of the Great Hall. The atmosphere in the castle was as festive as ever, and Flitwick had made a big splash this year.
   Today there were dangers all day long. Skeletons jumped out of the walls, portraits turned out to be disguised, fake monsters, stepping on the carpet you could fall into a small hole with magic quicksand, taking the railing - to get into fake, sweet, but bright blood, and in general, all day long students were provided with various tests on fortitude and strength of mind.
   By evening, the Hall and Great Hall looked like a crypt. Fake ghosts hovered under the ceiling, startling the students with their sharp dives and hollow howls. Spiderwebs dangled everywhere, with transfigured pseudo-acromantulas that could land on your shoulder or head. There were cackling, glowing pumpkins flying around, sometimes whispering terrible threats of a quick but painful death in your ear. And that, the unmoving figure of the surreal monster, could suddenly come to life and leap under your feet, scaring you to graying temples.
   But Ilves liked it - Hogwarts had amazing holidays. True, they would have been even better if not for the presence of the Golden Trio here. The weasel didn't believe in the curse of the post, but the curse of the Trio and the feast did. Besides, Potter's parents had died that day, so it would have been more understandable if the bespectacled boy had been visiting their grave on the 31st, rather than causing trouble for the whole castle. But such matters were a matter of internal organization and upbringing.
   But the door of the Hall swung open, and Ilya swallowed his saliva and forgot all his thoughts and business. When free food is on the horizon, you should not fill your head with such empty problems. The most important thing is to fill your belly and the whole world can wait.
   
   
   
   
   A couple of kilos of food later.
    
    
    
    
   Ilya, having waddled with the faculty to the living room, thought that it was worth believing the proverb of the scouts. The first time was an accident, two times a coincidence, three times a pattern. That is, since only two Halloweens had passed, it was not necessary to say that Potter had cursed the holiday with his presence.
   The people began to disperse to their rooms, and Ilya decided to sit down on a cozy sofa and relax a little after the food marathon. Most likely, the sixth piece of cake was already unnecessary. And I shouldn't have chewed two chickens. Two whole chickens. But habits are habits, they're hard to break. And if you've heard for twelve years that free food is higher than holy, you can't get rid of such notions in two years.
   Weasel himself did not notice how he sank into a sweet slumber. And it seemed to him that only a couple of minutes had passed before Flint's wild yell was heard:
   - Everybody gather round and line up! We're going to the Great Hall!
   - What, is the banquet still going on? - Ilya, who had been asleep for a long time, turned to the headman.
   - No, Potter was attacked in the living room by Black.
   Silence.
   - It's not a joke.
   - I'm just dicking around with my genius," and with a ringing slap, Ilya's palm said hello to his face.
   He doesn't seem to have another normal holiday for another four years.
 

Chapter 27
   December 8, 1993 England, Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
    
   Winter. Oh this beautiful word - winter. The time when you go out in the street you will definitely check if you have a warm hat on your head, a colorful or even colorless scarf on your neck, and under a thick coat or down jacket you will have warm clothes.
   That time when in the morning and in the evening, frost patterns appear on the windows, so diverse and artistic, as if a brilliant artist walks with a special brush and leaves his masterpieces on the simple glass. When you can always hear the laughter of children in the streets, molding snowballs or playing snowballs, trying to beat the enemy.
   When, going out for a walk with your girlfriend, you will definitely try to shovel her in the snow, or drop white flakes from the nearest branch. When even the most fleeting kiss is like a charcoal applied to the lips. Winter, the table is a beautiful time when everything around is wrapped in a white, fluffy blanket. A time for evening gatherings by the fireplace and warm embraces. Winter... Ilya realized more and more that he hated this time, this winter.
   Wrapping himself in a worn gray drapery coat with a high collar, putting on a hat with earflaps donated by the Russians, and putting on thick gloves, Prunyra went out into the hall. Almost the whole school from the third to seventh year had already gathered here. In connection with the emergence of Dementors on the border of the territory, only after three and a small months, the students decided to release to Hogsmeade. Now everyone was standing near the exit, showing Filch and McGee, standing next to him, their permission to visit the magical village.
   Mr. and Mrs. had signed the paper before Ilya even thought of asking them to do so. So there was nothing wrong with the ex-bosoda's credentials. The same could not be said for the Potter in front, who, as usual, could not do without excesses. But the worst part was that he was holding up the whole line.
   - But, ma'am, why don't you sign? - Goggles almost squeaked.
   - I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, but the rules say that either a parent or a guardian has to sign. I'm really sorry.
   - But...
   - Harry," Hermione cut in. - Maybe it's for the best. It's not safe for you to leave school right now.
   - Mr. Potter, Miss Granger says some very reasonable things," the Iron Lady smiled slightly.
   - Yeah, buddy, and we'll get you all kinds of goodies," Ron clapped his friend on the shoulder and smiled broadly. - And we'll tell you all the interesting stuff.
   Potter sighed heavily, whispered something in reply, took his sheet, and departed, shoulders slumped mournfully. Ilya, pulling his ID card from his bag, just in time to see how the Blizen jumped out of the queue and led Potter under the arm into some nook. They're up to something again...
   McGonagall checked the document for almost five minutes. She spun it, twisted it, shined her wand at it, sniffed at it, and maybe even tasted it on her teeth. Ilya the whole time just rolled his eyes and stomped on the spot, trying to warm himself somehow. Weasel hated the cold even more than winter, and since they always walked side by side, Ilya hated the cold winter twice, if not threefold.
   - It doesn't look fake," the deputy director gave her verdict.
   - You could have just asked," Ilya sighed, taking the document and walking out the school gate.
   The weasel lifted his collar, hiding his chin in it, and slowly crunched his boots into the annoyingly white snow. A snowball flew past, which Ilya dodged by swinging back slightly. The freshmen rushed past, using levitation charms for their amusement. They were having fun, and Weasel was chortling. It was like this every winter, but in recent years, the weaving peculiarity of the young man was becoming more pronounced. And this time the moping was joined by bad moods and bouts of unreasonable irritation and even anger.
   The boy was not only bored, he was also always getting into trouble, picking fights. But no one wanted to fight with Ilya. Maybe because at fourteen with a tail, weasel looked at all seventeen, or maybe just for reasons of humanity. And wanted to fight, wanted to stand tall and punch someone in a satisfied face. But, alas, mages preferred to fight with wands rather than fists. Which, in a way, was fine too. But there was a lot of damage to be done in a magic duel, and it was a hell of a lot more common than a regular scuffle. He was so excited to fight, to warm up, to warm up...
   - Ilya, wait! - A sound came from behind me.
   At first Ilya thought it was his buddies, but they were out on dates, and there was no chance that they would prefer to sit in a coffee shop and take a walk with a frowning Ilya. Weasel turned around and saw Danger with Red.
   Ron was dressed as he always was - bland and unkempt, and Hermione looked like a regular London schoolgirl. For a moment, Ilya thought about the fact that Ronald was always ready to have a fist fight. So he could, for instance, punch him now, and start a fistfight. But with so many witnesses, Ilya would probably be stripped of up to a hundred points and a couple of hours of lectures with Snape, even scarier than the fiery Geena. The lectures were scary in their sizzle and universal boredom.
   - What do you want? - Weasel grumbled.
   - Mrs. Weasley asked me to keep an eye on you," Hermione replied, as if it were a matter of course.
   - Get lost," Ilya muttered, and turned a hundred and eighty and staggered towards Hogsmeade, but he was grabbed rather sharply by the elbow.
   - We're going together," Hermione said firmly.
   It was obvious that Ron wasn't happy about the prospect and supported the Slytherin's wish. The wish was for the slug to get the hell out of here.
   - Where I go, you don't go.
   - And where did you...
   - The Cabana's Head.
   - But it's only accessible from seventeen! - Danger exclaimed.
   Ilya raised his right eyebrow skeptically and glared at the girl. She immediately hesitated and felt embarrassed. It was immediately clear that if he did not ask for documents, Ilya would be able to safely enter this place.
   - And what are you going to do there?
   - Shit! I'll eat porridge and drink milk! Get out of here, you little brat!
   Hermione let go of Ilya and pursed her lips, and Ron was about to jump in, but he caught Weasel's pleading gaze. It was like he was saying, "Please, I beg you, do something stupid and I'll be happy to break your breadcrumb. And Ronald stayed where he was, not shackled by fear, but simply confused. Ilya exhaled a little disappointed and wandered back down the beaten path.
   
   
   
   Hogsmeade was just an ordinary English village. No ruins, no slanted fences, no broken-down roads. Everything was orderly, everything was well-maintained. Fences are matched to one another and always nicely painted. Houses, like clones of each other, are made of white brick and cherry planks. Gently tiled roofs, windows with flowers on the sill and sewn curtains. And a cobblestone paved road. If you didn't know it was a Magic Village, you wouldn't know it at once.
   Ilya noticed that the door of one of the houses opened and an older woman flew in, hugging an older woman tightly. She must have been a local. There were about three dozen kids in Hog, and many of the younger ones were jealous of them. They said they could visit their parents more often, and in general they did not mind going to an ordinary, district school.
   There was a woman's laughter, and then a distinctive sound. Ilya saw that George, hugging Alicia, had finally caught up with his kiss. A little ahead of them was Angelina, with Fred holding her waist. They walked to the Three Broomsticks, the most popular place in the neighborhood. They could eat there and drink a milkshake called "Creamy Beer.
   Ilya's path lay elsewhere, past the Zonko shop, which was usually full of youngsters. Leaving behind the maddening Madame Puddifoot's, where the boys were lured by the craziest of ladies. Passing a series of different shops and a chain hotel for magicians, Dixon and Sons.
   But a building loomed ahead, with the dried heads of some magical creatures at the entrance. The bar was relatively large, with a characteristic entourage and even a vintage Texas door - two flaps swiveling to either side. You might ask why it was so warm inside - magic, gentlemen, magic.
   Ilya stepped closer and the heads bellowed in unison, but as soon as he pointed and middle finger, they fell silent. The flaps creaked open, attracting the visitors' attention for a moment, but then everyone went back to their business.
   There were a relatively large number of people, and not the most intelligent-looking ones. There were some obvious businessmen, some information mongers, some peddlers with forbidden goods, but there were also those who came in for a drink as well.
   Passing the old oak tables, firmly nailed to the floor, Weasel sat down on a high chair behind the bar riser. He unzipped his coat, took off his hat, laid it beside him, and tapped the bar with his palm. After a couple of seconds, a stoutly built old man approached him, wiping down a glass. It wasn't a secret, but little did anyone know that the local host, Abeforth, was also Albus Dumbledore's older brother. Few knew that, but Ilya did. Abeforth told him himself. And don't ask how and when they met, it's too long and tedious a story.
   - Hello," Weasel waved a hand.
   - Well, hello," the bartender said with a smirk. - What's your poison?
   
   *(p.a. In Scottish, Canadian, Irish, American, British and probably, but I don't know - Australian bars, they ask "What'syourpoison? The phrase has no exact translation, but that's what it's supposed to sound like. )
   
   - Something hot," he shrugged. - He shrugged. "I'm going to have to get some more of that.
   - Wait for it.
   And Abefort departed. Ilya got two coins in advance. One for the drink, the other for the food. The old man returned soon enough. In his right hand he carried a plate of fried onion rings, fries, and five aromatic ribs, and in his left a bottle of single malt whisky and a ribbed wide glass.
   The host put a plate in front of the young man, putting him three napkins, but no knife or fork. Contrary to misconception, fried onions, fries, and ribs should be eaten with your hands. Abefort tossed two pieces of ice into the glass and poured three fingersfuls.
   Ilya nodded and slid two coins forward. The barman took one, put the other in a special box, and wrote something in the book that said "Weasel. The ignorant would not say anything about it, but the knowledgeable would say that the second shekel had gone to the account of the fellow at the bar. You wouldn't think a three-finger whisky would cost nearly three pounds, would you?
   Ilya nodded, tasted onions and potatoes, and then drank the whiskey. It cut his throat a little at first, but then honey spilled down his throat and a hot heat spread over his chest and stomach. Weasel put his fist to his mouth, exhaled sharply, and sank his teeth into a juicy, flavorful rib.
   While Ilya ate and drank, he did not pay attention to what was happening, but he should have. A blizzard raged outside the window, and in an instant the windows were frozen to such a state that one could even hear them ghostly crackle. Shouts and light cursing could be heard of people seeking shelter from the harsh, aching cold. And the bar was filling faster and faster with people. Two young waitresses were barely able to keep up with the kitchen while the cooks must have had their work cut out for them.
   - Hey, buddy," some body approached Ilya, eyeing around warily. - You're not interested in the silver girl?
   Weasel could barely keep from choking on a rib. Muggles had their own demons, like heroin, but muggles had "silverware. A kind of powder that looked like stardust. You sniff it once, and it's like you're in heaven. At least, that's how the junkies described it. Yeah, don't believe anyone who says magic poisons aren't addictive. Bullshit. If you don't get addicted to it, you wouldn't make a profit and after the third puff you won't be able to imagine your life without the powder. And if you first push a dose of one gold, then six months later you will demand ten, if not more. In short, the scams are the same here as they are in Skary.
   - How much?
   - Ten shekels for half an ounce," the dealer sniffed, staring again.
   Ilya quickly calculated that it came out to almost eighty pounds for fourteen grams.
   - It's expensive," Ilya began to haggle.
   - Come on, man, at Lyutnoy you'll get at least a fiver.
   - Well, we're not in Lyutnoe," Ilya shrugged. He wiped the grease off with a napkin, and then, maneuvering his little finger away, he sipped his whiskey.
   - All right, all right, eight shekels.
   - Come on.
   Ilya counted out the eight coins in his pocket, clenched them in his fist, and handed them to the peddler. He looked around again, and, pressing the paper envelope against his palm with his thumb a couple of centimeters, held out his hand - as if he wanted to say hello.
   Suddenly weasel suddenly threw his left sharply, firmly squeezing the wrist bargain hunter.
   - Hey, Abefort, you got cockroaches in here.
   Diller was taken aback at first, but then he realized that it smelled like Azkaban baloney. He tried to break free at first, but Weasel had his wrist in a vice-like grip. Then he drew his wand. Ilya, scattering coins on the floor, simply ripped it out of the dealer's hands.
   The bartender came up and, with a slight movement of his hand, sent a clever spill right into the head of the salesman. He collapsed and sat down on his chair as if he were drunk. The whole petty scene never drew any attention. Not even the clinking of coins evoked any emotion. Seekly Pryor swept his hand briskly away - magic had no effect on money.
   - Everyone goes this way," Abefort shook his head, nodding to one of the bouncers.
   These huge, austere-looking men were sitting at a separate table at the very entrance. The most overpowering one jumped up and carried him to the kitchen, like a feather. Further the fate of the businessman was clear - first they'll beat the shit out of him, and then bound and cut down, with the material docks in his pocket, will be thrown on the doorstep of the local department of Aurorat. He had to be in the middle of the night, and then he had to be tied up, knocked out of his pocket, and then thrown on the doorstep of the local Aurorat office.
   Usually, of course, the money is knocked off, those who are more prinprincipled - "stage" in Tsugundera, and newcomers to the Ministry, and there is bound to have the roof of a pusher in the presence. But if the pusher is put out of business, he won't be able to sell anyway - if he's not sent to a hospital, he'll die. Bouncer probably break his legs and ribs, and not with his hands, but with some curses. Anyway, one way or another, this shrewd fellow would never come here again.
   - I don't like druggies and bargain hunters," Ilya grimaced and wiped his hands on the napkins. Then he looked at the food and pushed it aside - his appetite was gone.
   He gestured for a refill as he swallowed his glass. Abefort poured two fingers. That was the custom. Three if asked for with food, two if not. Of course, everybody wants money, but nobody wants a drunken customer.
   - Should I give you a bonus? - The bartender snorted.
   - Nah, put it on my tab for catching that ghoul.
   - Well," the headmaster's brother shrugged, and was about to go to the other end of the counter when he turned around. - He was about to leave for the other end of the counter.
   Weasel mentally cursed.
   - Actually, I wanted to push her.
   - Also a thought," and Abefort took off.
   Ilya put the weapons he had won in the battle into his bag. Now he would have to share it with this old man. If he could get his wand on the black market at Lyutnoe for, say, five gold pieces, then Abeforth would have to shell out at least a dozen shekels, if not the whole galleon. Another waste - what an eye-opener the bartender here is...
   Weasel, noticing that the bar is too crowded, decided that he should get out before the bartender cheated him for another percentage. After leaving seven kanats for tea, Ilya put on his earflaps, wrapped his coat and strode out.
   He lingered a little on the threshold, but still strode resolutely out. The moment the "cowboy windows" (a.k.a. those doors were called that) creaked open behind him, weasel almost gnashed his teeth from the cold. Without thinking too much, the Slytherin except that he rushed to the Three Brooms. It was a quieter place than the Boar's Head, where he shouldn't be seen for months.
   The front door creaked open, and a tall hanger approached Illya, hunching his shoulders in a bow. Weasel brushed aside the artifact, keeping his coat with him. The hanger, not the least bit upset, approached the next visitor.
   Ilya looked around, but among the huge number of tables, he saw only more people. Everything was packed everywhere, and there was no chance to find a free seat. Though, there, in the distance, by the stairs leading to the upper floors with the rooms, was an inconspicuous table. Seated at it were the easily recognizable identities of Weasley and Granger. But what was more appealing was that they had a vacant chair. Ilya smirked - they asked to go with them themselves.
   Weasel squeezed his way through the crowd and stepped closer, a loud chuckle drawing attention to himself. Ron and Hermione immediately looked up, but strangely, there was a look of confusion on their faces. It was as if they were scrambling to find a way out of the situation. Ilya was about to pull back a vacant chair and give the boys a nudge when he sensed, literally, that something was wrong.
   Ilya sniffed the air and clearly distinguished that there were not two but three people sitting at the table. And the smell of the third was very familiar. Ilya put his hand down on a presumably empty space, but felt a man's shoulder under his palm.
   - So we're dabbling in invisibility robes," the understanding Slytherin smirked. He wanded a chair to himself and sat down next to it. - That's how you used to follow me around in freshman year. Clever.
   - What are you doing here, Ilya? - Potter's voice came from the void.
   - Actually, your friends wanted to keep an eye on me at Mrs.'s request.
   - And you left yourself," Ronald muttered.
   - Hermione," Ilya let that statement slip past his ears, and then lied easily. - I'm sorry I snapped, I didn't mean to offend.
   The girl snorted and shrugged, showing that she didn't care.
   - Fine," Ilya smiled, pleased that the conspirators weren't holding a grudge against him. They could be more trouble than a disgruntled McGee.
   The waitress passed by, and Ilya, who knew what to do, beckoned her. The girl smiled radiantly at Ilya and accepted the order and in a couple of minutes there was a mug of hot chocolate on the table. Weasel put his hands on the walls of the container and blissfully exhaled. The heat seemed to be absorbed into the guy, slowly "warming up" what the whiskey had not warmed.
   - We actually wanted to talk," Granger remarked.
   - About how great it would be to find out all about Black?
   The trio choked, but no one knew what Potter choked on. Invisible people are like that.
   - How did you...
   - I'm Ilya," the still somewhat boastful young man shrugged. - There's nothing I don't know.
   - Well, well," Hermione said, cryptic for some reason.
   Weasel wanted to say that he had even guessed against his will about her time-wheel, but decided that was unnecessary. Let the girl remain blissfully unaware that the Slytherin knew everything. The funny thing was, her friends had no idea, and Ilya had cracked the riddle without even intending to. It was just that at some point it was no longer possible not to understand.
   Weasel was about to answer something like that, though, when new actors entered the room - Madame Rosmerta, the pub landlady, Professor McGonagall, and, surprisingly, Minister Fudge. They were joined by Flitwick, who had inexplicably come from nowhere, and some other man.
   For some part, the goblin noticed Ilya, who in turn nodded to the enchantment master, but it was clear that in this case, Filius would have preferred to have the conversation elsewhere.
   - Oh, you're the Minister," Rosmerta began to rant, her arms folded into her rather large sides. - Come to see your own handiwork? ?? I've had all my visitors dispersed by my Dementors!
   - Rosmerta, dear," the minister held up his hands in a conciliatory gesture, trying to placate the hostess. - You do realize this is all because of Black.
   - Black," the pub-keeper grimaced, and she looked down at him. - What a lad she'd been... And what a friend of the Potters...
   - Rosmerta! - McGonagall shouted slightly, nodding discreetly at Red and Danger. - Not here.
   - Oh, yes, why am I keeping you in the hall, let's go upstairs.
   And the four wizards began to walk up the stairs leading to the rooms. Before anyone knew it, there was the sound of a chair pulling back, and the rustling of cloth on the wooden floor.
   - Harry! - Hermione hissed, but Potter was already scurrying up the stairs, judging by the smell.
   - Oh, yeah," Ilya stretched out, throwing his legs up on the chair he had vacated.
   - So what do we do? - is, as I'm sure you can understand, Ronald asked.
   - Waiting. - Granger muttered heavily.
   Ilya smiled victoriously and closed his eyes. Somehow the darkness fell, the sounds became many times clearer, as if someone turned a switch, amplifying them several times, but Ilya was not concerned with the hubbub of the crowd of visitors. He mentally climbed the stairs, leaving the background noise and commotion behind, and just as mentally put his ear to the keyhole and listened to the voices. They sounded quiet at first, as if from under the floor, but the more Ilya listened, the more clearly he distinguished the words, and soon he understood the whole speech.
   - Such a tragedy, such a tragedy, but what a good, what a good man he was.
   - A lot of people would disagree with you, dear. The things he and Potter did together.
   - But when they were young, when they were hot, oh, how sad... Do you remember, Professor Flitwick, how they blew up the Christmas tree in the third year?
   - I remember.
   - But how come, how come...
   - People change, Rosmerta," it was probably McGee, but the tone of the voices was hard to distinguish, like they were one color. After all, Ilya wasn't a beast to distinguish that, either.
   - But not in a couple of years. After all, both of them had fought the Dark Lord after high school. What kind of friends they were, like brothers... There was no water to spill...
   - If memory serves, Black was best man at Mr. and Mrs. Potter's wedding?
   - Of course it was. The whole foursome was there, but Black was the only one standing at the altar with his friend. The closest, most loyal...
   - who ended up a traitor, who'd have thought... All that's left of Pittagrew is a finger, just his little finger.
   There was the creak of a door and the sharp thump of boots on the stairs. It was Potter - no doubt about it. He stormed out of the place, and his friends rushed after him. Ilya decided to stay and listen.
   - According to the guards, before he escaped, Black kept saying, "He's at Hogwarts, he's at Hogwarts." So don't be angry, Rosmerta, it's just the way things are these days.
   - Yeah, I get it. It must be hard for Harry.
   - He doesn't know everything about Black - he hasn't been told.
   - Well, that's right, you don't need to know that - you can't.
   - But the most surprising thing," the voice, which probably belonged to the Minister, interjected again. -Bellatrix Lestrange, sitting in the next cell, was acting strangely, too.
   - Wasn't it always like this?
   - In a way, yes, but now she's literally staggering. She's cowering in a corner, trembling with fear, crying out, "He's coming for me, he's coming for me. The Dementors say there's never been such fear from prisoners before.
   - Who could Leistrange be so afraid of?
   - Who knows, who knows. Maybe he thinks Frank and Alice's son is coming for revenge...
   Ilya wouldn't listen to any further. He didn't want to miss all the fun that would start when Ron and Hermione caught up with Potter. And that there would be fun was not to be doubted. Weasel left a few bronze coins for tea this time too, put on his earflaps again, and pulled his coat up and headed for the exit.
   There was still a strong northerly wind blowing outside, bringing with it a real blizzard. Probably those Russians would have laughed now, saying that it was not a blizzard but just a light weather, but Ilya had enough of that. In a moment lashes were frozen, except that they acquired icicles, eyes hurt and skin on the lips began to stretch like rubber balloons. It was cold. Ilya hated the cold, but curiosity drove him on.
   Despite the cold, Ilya was able to make out the scents in the air. Like a bloodhound, sipping his nose, he walked toward the edge of the forest. People were still wandering around, seeking shelter, wandering either into Rosmerta's pub or Abefort's bar. But the closer he got to the forest, the fewer passersby and the laughing boys sheltering the girls from the cold with their bodies.
   To many people the forest in winter seemed something surrealistically beautiful. All those snow caps, the firs, dressed in fluffy mantles, snowy glades and paths, the play of light in the ice crystals, but Ilya did not like the winter forest. Winter forest was silent, it told him nothing, there were no animals, no birds, exactly nothing. And the deeper weasel climbed into the winter forest, the more he wanted to sleep. Eyes fell asleep, he wanted to wrap himself deep in warm clothes. Fall in somewhere and wake up a couple of times a day for a few hours to eat. But weasel could easily cope with this obsession - only part of him wanted to sleep, and the other part felt quite normal.
   At last among the trees Ilya discerned three figures. The tallest was standing beside the stocky one, sitting on a stump, and the third, huddled in a lumpy embrace with the stocky one. If Ron was jealous of his friend, he hid it quite successfully. But that was of little concern to Ilya. He seemed to be in time for the fun part. Potter was almost choking back tears and clenching his little fists. It was a pitiful sight. The only thing Ilya couldn't tolerate stronger than weakness was tears - no matter if they were male or female. They always enraged him. However, it was the men's, and the women's tears caused confusion mixed with irritation.
   - They believed him," Ilya heard him sobbing. Illya wanted to punch Potter in the face. What self-respecting guy would whine in front of a girl. That's it, after a feint like that in the eyes of any worthwhile lady, you'd be beneath the plinth. - They believed, and he betrayed them! Betrayed them!
   - Harry... - Hermione whispered, but she couldn't find words of comfort.
   She simply couldn't understand Potter. And not many people could - Neville could, the sixth-year Puffendup orphan could, Ilya could, but he didn't want to understand such weakness. His understanding was simple - kill your enemy, live happily ever after. No tears, no worries, just the moment and the joy in that moment. There was no yesterday and no tomorrow, only now. But to live with such principles you have to live most of your life in Scari, when remembering yesterday you want to howl, tearing your throat open, and tomorrow is better not to think, because it may not exist. No, Illya didn't want to understand these home kids.
   - I will find him and... ...and I will have my revenge. You hear me? I'm gonna kill him!
   Ron and Hermione looked confused, and Potter's cheeks were already glistening with frozen tear tracks. Here Ilya just couldn't help himself and gave vent to his winter irritation. In the clearing, amidst the snow and wind, a laughter that sounded like springtime dripping began, but even so, it was very, very hurtful.
   Potter glared menacingly in Ilya's direction, Ron clenched his fists, Hermione pursed her lips, and Ilya still couldn't stop himself. He leaned against a tree and laughed. He wasn't just laughing at Trio, he was laughing at the fact That he realized how much different he was from the wizards living in the castle. Not just in appearance, not just in power, but in the way he looked at life. Once it seemed to him that these magicians are abnormal, but now Ilyev suddenly became clearly understood - abnormal himself, his childhood, its values, principles and concepts, all this is not normal for a civilized society, in all it stinks too much Scary-square. And it was getting ridiculous that he wanted to be as naive and simple as Potter for a moment, he wanted to, but he could not. As Flitwick said rightly, only the few can understand, and only such people should be held. Ilya had no one to hold on to in the wizarding world...
   - Oh, you're such a jerk," Weasel wiped away his tears and mocked Goggles. - "I'll kill him!" Ha-ha-ha-ha.
   - You... - Ronald growled.
   - He was in the middle of a tears, and he pulled out his wand and threw a stunner or a spell at Black. Potter would pull out his wand, crying, and throw stunners or cotton-foot spells at Black! But no, beforehand, I'm sure you'd apply the skill of forgiveness and universal justice and send Black to the authorities.
   - What do you mean by that? - Granger hissed, getting to her feet and shutting Potter down for some reason.
   That's what Ilya was talking about. Hermione is already instinctively holding her mate up as a wuss, and her maternal instinct for protection kicks in. Abomination...
   - What I say," Weasel shrugged. - Potter's a whiner, a weakling, and a sissy. And a fool, too.
   - You don't talk about Harry like that! - wailed Ronald. - You take that back right now!
   - Please, Red, make me do it - take them back.
   No one stopped Weasley this time, and he raised his wand. At that moment, white lightning flashed through the space. Ron collapsed in the snow, pressing his hand to his cheek, blood gushing from it. Beside him lay a sharp icicle, tossed with the force of a steel bolt from a crossbow.
   - It didn't work out, did it? - Ilya smirked.
   He felt perfect. Finally a fight, finally a heart beating so fast and desperate, so easy to breathe and so bright in color. At last he felt warm...
   Hermione tried to conjure something, but Ilya was faster. He shot out a binding spell and Hermione's arm was tethered tightly to her body in an instant. The wand glanced neatly at her feet. With the next spell, Weasel easily dropped the girl into the snow, so that she had no chance of doing anything.
   - One at a time, Potter. Just the way you like it - all Gryffindor style.
   Harry, getting into his battle swing, didn't think for long. He raised his wand and bellowed loudly:
   - Expulsio!
   Ilya literally felt a wall of compressed air coming at him. On reflexes and reaction alone, the Slytherin made a dizzying leap, finding himself far away from the impact zone. Then there was an explosion. The snow was blown to shreds, several trees were broken, lumps of earth flew into the air, and a crater of considerable size formed where Weasel had been standing.
   Potter, like all wizards his age, froze, staring at the work of his hands and it cost him everything. Ilya's wand flickered, merging into a single ball of fire, the Elder Runes whistling in the air, the non-verbal formula whispered mentally, and then the verbal:
   - Ignis Flamantis!
   Once upon a time a maniac had said that Ilya didn't have the strength for the Flaming Lash, but he was wrong - Ilya did. But Ilya found this spell too unwieldy, too cheesy, too lacking in grace, charm, style, and everything that Weasel and Flitwick valued so much. So Ilya created his own charms-the Flaming Whip charms. You could cut with it, you could punch with it, you could burn with it, or you could use it instead of that very whip. Easy, elegant, and deadly.
   The Flaming Whip (one of the four spells that had nothing to do with the Flaming Beasts) clicked, and Potter's wand flew out of his hands. Harry grimaced - a huge bruise was sprawling on his arm. Ilya didn't want to burn it - it wasn't worth leaving such an obvious mark on it.
   Another swing of his wand and the whip wrapped around Potter's neck, squeezing it in a vise. Harry grasped the fiery whip with his hands, but he didn't have a chance to release the vice. Just then Ron began to come to, recovering from the pain and shock, but Ginger didn't have a chance - Ilya's shoe had already slammed into his face.
   - It's not like killing enslaved basilisks on swords or shoving sticks up trolls' noses, Potter. To kill is to take everything from a man and watch as the light slowly fades in his eyes, as fear mingles with awakening, as the cold breath of Death blows. To kill is to leave someone an orphan, someone a widow. To take a son or a daughter, a friend or a brother. You make it sound so simple - to kill... It's a good thing you don't know what Scary Square is, or you'd never say the word. If you're going to kill and you don't, then you're a nobody, a nobody, a nobody...
   With each word, the whip slowly tightened around Potter's throat, and he wheezed and whistled.
   - A bunch of house kids throwing around such loud words," Ilya wanted to throw his wand aside and punch the chatterbox in the face with a pull, but he didn't do it. He just knew that he would regret the breakdown in the spring, when he would be warm again.
   - Stop it! - Hermione screamed. - You're strangling him!
   - You see," Ilya grinned. - You're not dead yet, and they're already crying about you. Even for a lowlife like you.
   Weasel loosened his grip, and Potter collapsed to the ground. He was slowly regaining consciousness, gasping for air with his mouth.
   - Snotlout," Ilya spat, and then reminded himself why he'd arranged all this. - If you ever try to "look out" for me again, much less say it in public, I'll give you hell on earth. So long, pups.
   And Ilya staggered back to the castle, feeling gradually colder and colder again. Ilya hated winter, hated the cold, but he did not know yet that very soon he would hate it even more... The holidays were approaching.
   
   

Chapter 28.
   December 24, 1993 England, Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
   The last day of school was held, as always. Everyone and everyone, including the teachers, didn't give a damn about school. Everyone lived in anticipation of the evening's festive dinner, followed by the departure from the alma mater of all the wizards of Foggy Albion. But even so, there were exceptions in the castle. Namely Professor McGonagall and her protégé, Hermione Granger.
   The day was wrapping up horribly today. If there was only one pair of Herbalism before lunch, there were two pairs of Transfiguration after the window and lunch. Get a load of that. Two. Pairs. Transfiguration. Sure, on paper, it's just a bunch of letters, carrying images of simple numbers, but in practice... In practice, it's three hours with the Iron Lady and the nerdy Danger.
   Ilya could endure a lot. The winter, the rabid iron golems, the neighborhood with Slabozady and his crew, the potions lessons, but three hours with the Dean of Scarlet and the school's head crammer, it was like punishment from heaven. Weasel, lying on his desk, his cheek propped on his hand, with a completely blank and absent look all trying to understand what he was so wrong that the all-forgiving god decided so to overthrow him. But no matter how much Ilya dug into his memories, he could not find fault.
   Of course, maybe, just maybe, you should not have mined the deputy director's office last month, and then detonated five stink bombs there. It was not necessary to put invisible buttons on her chair and put in her coffee magic hair dye, and those blasphemous poems were also unnecessary ... The only thing is that they were innocent children's pranks, and they did not deserve such terrible punishment. For example, Snape was treated even worse - he still searches everyone for offensive pictures, but nothing - no reinforced doses of the Half-haired Man.
   - Mr. Ilya, what are you doing in my class?
   - Just pondering the eternal, ma'am," muttered Weasel, still staring blankly at one point.
   - What did you have in mind? - With a touch of sarcasm, McGee asked.
   - That the eternal is eternal. Isn't that a revolutionary discovery?
   - Minus twenty points for rudeness," the professor cut her off sharply.
   - You see, ma'am," sighed Ilya. - You haven't grasped that level of zen yet, you can't understand the eternal.
   - I'll charge you half a hundred more if you don't show me a job well done.
   - What do I care about points, ma'am, when I see the eternal...
   - Minus...
   - Wait, wait," Ilya waved his hand. - It seems that the eternal, offended by you, has departed. Well, then I can go back to the mortal earth, where the only things that matter to people are points and completed tasks.
   Weasel turned to the mouse, winked at it, waved his wand, said the formula, and a bright green parrot with a red beak appeared on the table. Ilya felt a strong weakness, but anticipated what was to happen in a moment.
   The little bird opened its beak and shouted to the whole audience:
   - Maaaa k-G-G-G-Gi durr-r-r-r-ra! Maa k-G-G-Gi durr-r-r-ah!
   A wave of laughter swept through the office, and Ilya, according to a well-established pattern, left the accessories in a bag and flew out the door. This time he did not even clap them - so as not to drown out the parrot's dithyrambs. And don't even ask how Ilya pulled off this trick - real weasels don't reveal their secrets.
   Ilya, bag slung over his shoulder, hat pulled down over his eyes, shivering in the rare cold wind, staggered toward Flitwick.
   This time we had to work hard to come up with Christmas presents for him and the director. Of course for people in such an advanced age it is difficult to think of gifts, because they either already have everything or don't need anything. So it is not surprising that Ilya stopped at books, but what kind of books can be given to people who have read tens, if not hundreds of thousands of works in their lifetime.
   The answer, however, was found; Ilya sent the Headmaster a historical fantasy by a very famous author, and Flitwick a book of recipes. Yes, yes, a book of recipes. It was just that at some point the goblin had once mentioned that he was quite curious about how Muggles cook without magic, so now he had to figure out what and why.
   Ilya himself was relatively unable to cook. Exactly, he could not. Ilya could make himself a sandwich, heat up a half-finished meal, but to cook from scratch... that was beyond him. However, Ilya could always tell by the smell of the cafe, which would get the freshest and best, after consuming which there would be no desire to live in the apartment "white friend".
   This also applied to street vendors. If you want to try a proper burrito or a hot dog, don't forget to ask Weasel where they sell them, otherwise you are guaranteed some problems.
   Weasel came out to Hog's main "artery" - the stairs. It was as if they were trembling with anticipation of another amusement. The problem was that the secret passages leading upstairs were in another wing. So after the Transfiguration class weasel had no chance of getting past those wooden bitches.
   Ilya slung the bag over his shoulder, tightening the strap so that the tube dangled more under his butt than it did at his side. Then he adjusted his hat, crunched his fingers and cervical vertebrae, and jumped on the first one. It sprang into action at once, vaporized a few steps and flew off in the wrong direction. But he, who had already learned by bitter experience, did not try to be funny and jumped on the railing.
   Spreading out, Weasel ducked over the gaping gap and hooked his fingers on the next platform, jumped onto the next railing in one cohesive motion. Alas, this ladder proved more treacherous - it flew down. So Illya summoned the Flaming Whip and used it as a liana. After playing Tarzan, Ilya did end up on the fifth floor level. Here he ignored the stairs and began to climb the protruding wall bas-relief.
   Then, at the very edge of the bas-relief, he pushed off with his legs and swooped down to the other ladder. It tried to swim away, but did not have time, and weasel caught on it. Another tug, a leap, a run up the steps disappearing under his feet, and here Ilya was at his goal.
   Ilya stopped, turned around, bent his right hand and struck the bend with his left, at the same time straightening the middle finger of his right. The ladders squeaked and cracked and began to return to their previous position. The silliest thing about this whole situation is that they only behaved this way when Ilya was alone. So even if I told anyone, they wouldn't believe it.
   The Slytherin slung the bag onto one shoulder, loosened the strap as much as possible so that the bag wasn't hanging off his knee, lifted his hat slightly, and moved down the corridor. The walls were playfully flickering with the glow of magic torches. Sometimes the tapestries whirred, lending an all too palpable sense of reality to the intricately woven images. At times the tapestries seemed to suggest the appearance of a dragon about to burst forth and attack the knights' armor standing nearby. Pieces of an ancient mosaic could be seen on the ceiling, but it never made it to the present day. Yet despite all its shortcomings, Hogwarts was an amazing place, full of magic and joy. And Ilya was unspeakably glad that he had a chance to study here and absorb the inexpressible atmosphere of endless adventure.
   Ilya knocked and, as always, he heard:
   - Come in, Ilya.
   Ilya opened the door and immediately smiled. No matter what was going on outside the castle walls, it was always spring in this office. It was warm, cozy, spacious, and not at all cold. From December to February the young wizard of Scary Square tried to spend as much time as possible in this place. Otherwise he risked snapping and hurting someone, which he would surely regret.
   Ilya made his way to the cozy chair, which he already knew was his own. He sat down there, folding his bag at his feet and immediately grabbed a cup of hot chocolate, warming himself against its warmth. Flitwick, on the other hand, was chewing on his quill, as usual, calculating another formula.
   - What are you working on, Professor? - Ilya asked, popping a liver into his mouth.
   - Over the masterpiece, Ilya, over the masterpiece," the old man smiled a little sadly for some reason.
   - And what is this masterpiece going to be? And no, no, no, don't tell me, I already know - you want to create a singing pink elephant!
   - I was actually considering Cheburashka, but an elephant isn't a bad idea either.
   - I knew it! Sir, I've got you figured out! - the lad laughed.
   - I'm afraid," the enchanter said with a wave of his hands. - I didn't have a chance to resist.
   - That's right, Professor! Fear Ilya Ilya the genius third year.
   The goblin smiled for a fraction, then coughed into his handkerchief and, with a moment's glance at the white cloth, quickly tucked it into his pocket. Flitwick glanced at his calculations, then stacked the sheets of parchment and placed them on the edge of the table.
   - I heard a parrot singing in transfiguration class half an hour ago...
   - I've always been amazed at your awareness.
   - I was in the middle of the night," he said, and then he reached for the cup as well. Usually he held it by the ear with his little finger, but now for some reason he held it with both hands. - Be more careful in the future, Ilya, parrots are parrots, but the diploma is an important thing.
   - I can't promise you that," the brunette shook his head theatrically.
   - I didn't get my hopes up," the old wizard smiled again, a little sadly. - How were the last few days, Ilya?
   - I've almost finished the fifth beast," Ilya raised his chin haughtily.
   - You mean "fifth animals"?
   - Exactly, sir!
   You might be surprised that Flitwick knew about Ilya's classes, but, really, you shouldn't be. After all, he was the only one who knew. Apart from Illya himself, of course. Filius, the old rascal, picked up a liver with his fingernail and sent it flying picturesquely, ending up in the master's mouth. Ilya goggled his eyes and a moment later tried to do the same, but the liver hit his eye.
   - It seems you haven't mastered all my tricks yet, Ilya," the goblin smirked smugly at some point.
   - I still have time to catch up with you," Ilya waved his hand.
   - The time... - Flitwick stretched out and glanced at his watch on a chain. - Yes, you still have so much time Ilya. But don't waste it. It will end someday and I would not want you to be afraid or ashamed to turn around and look at the time you have lived.
   - As always - well said, sir!
   Flitwick gave a deliberately loud squelch and the young man smiled, the professor smiled as well, then they laughed for a while longer. It seemed like nothing, nothing to laugh about, but they were having fun nonetheless. Filius put his hand on the thick folder with the calculations, then on Ilya wiping away tears and nodded. Just like that - to himself.
   - You know, Ilya, I have forty-three reports on you in my desk in the last month alone.
   - A new record," Ilya said with bravado.
   - Alas, I don't understand how you, with such discipline, manage to remain a Top Student.
   - I'm just trying to prove that marks and discipline lie on different planes.
   Flitwick grunted, trying to hide the chuckle, and pulled out a new vase of brownies. Ilya's eyes glittered greedily, which made the world-famous duelist laugh again.
   - Someday you'll wish you hadn't been so heavy on sweets," the professor said as he held the vase out to him.
   - Medicine," Ilya clutched the bouchette. - works wonders. Especially magic medicine.
   They were silent, occasionally crunching sweets and slurping hot drinks. Outside the window the snowfall of fluffy snowflakes was whirling in a bizarre dance, but in the spacious office, it seemed that spring had frozen forever. It smelled of first flowers, swelling buds, awakening trees, and fresh grass. Ilya loved this place, it was something alive in the sometimes dead castle.
   - Do you have your key with you? - suddenly asked the master of spells.
   - You're insulting," Ilya shook his head, pulling out the right thing from his inside pocket. - I always carry it with me.
   - I didn't doubt it," Flitwick smiled and held out his hand. - May I?
   Ilya immediately put the key into his wrinkled palm. Filius looked at the "little bugger" - as Hagrid called them - then swiped his fingernail and returned it to the young man.
   - I hope you remember our agreement. - squinted at some part of the goblin.
   - No one is to enter while you are not in the castle," Weasel almost gestured.
   - You couldn't have said it better," Filius nodded.
   Ilya put away the key to the office and ran his fingers over the cakes, choosing which one to eat at a given moment. Finally the young man made his choice. He moved it to a separate saucer, then measured himself, and slammed his palm on the edge. The pastry flew into the air, and he grabbed it with his teeth.
   - Hahiyefo frücky I hwyufil! - With his mouth full, the Slytherin smiled.
   - Bravo, Ilya!" laughed Flitwick. - By the way, Mr. Ilya, there are already legends about your concerts around the castle, and I have never heard you play the guitar.
   Weasel gasped, then pounded his chest, looked at the professor, and blushed thickly.
   - ?... it's... but... - then the young man abruptly jumped up and yelled. - One moment!
   The lad, holding up his hat, ran to the other end of the study, where there was a stand with a case. Weasel took it off, unzipped it, and pulled the little girl out into the light. She was still the same as before. A six-stringed beauty with scarlet-green glowing veins. Muggles, when they saw her, would ask where they could order such a design, but Weasel just grinned enigmatically and answered that you had to know the places.
   Weasel went back, put the base "waist down" on his hip, and fiddled with the strings. He tweaked the pegs a little, hearing the tuning, then went over the frets again and nodded contentedly.
   - Ladies and gentlemen! - he shouted. - Hear, hear! Behind the instrument the best artist of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the future artist of the greatest theatres, as well as not yet crowned, but will be crowned as the King of Rock - Geeeeeeeeerbert Ilya!
   And Weasel, having strummed the first chord, began to play. At first he played his most favourite compositions. Sometimes they were riffs of very famous guitarists, and sometimes they were compositions heard in the passages. Students and ordinary street musicians played them, but music was beautiful because it was not important who played it, it was important how, it was important that the notes contained not only laws and rules, but the soul.
   Ilya, eyes covered, kept playing. His only listener, the old, little wizard with the big, warm heart, Philius Flitwick, leaned back in his chair and lowered his eyelids as well. The tension was gone from his face, his forehead wrinkles smoothed, his breathing evened out.
   The two mages never saw the window thaw, the flames that had recently been in chaos suddenly take on some shape and begin to dance gently. They did not see so much of what was going on around them, but they heard even more. They heard quiet notes, and frisky arrangements, cheerful and sometimes lyrical chords of the oldest and literally newborn compositions.
   Ilya was lost in the music, dissolving in it completely, giving himself up without a trace. And in that moment both the unhappy Prince and the impenetrable Ugly disappeared. Both of them were dissolving, disappearing like morning mist, giving chance to something more whole, to something more correct and real. Giving a chance to a third, so small, so weak, but also just as great and resilient. Resilient as a rock, over which the worst storm can rage, the most terrible storm, rain stone and split the heavens, but still stand.
   Ilya played his old, broken guitar, which even after repair was covered in cracks and even characteristic bullet holes, but he didn't care about that. He didn't care about mysteries and riddles and wizards and creatures and magical creatures. He didn't even care who he was, where he was coming from, or where he was going. He didn't care about anything. All that mattered was the six strings stretched and ten fingers running across them. That was all that mattered. That alone was the essence of what the Prince and the Ugly Man had so securely concealed, waiting for the moment when it could be handed to the one who would not break it by dropping it out of fear.
   You could say, "after so much time," but that would be a lie. For time, too, was frozen, listening to the music. It curled up and settled on the young man's lap, slowing its pace, literally vaporizing him. You couldn't tell if you were listening for ten minutes, twenty, an hour, or three. No one even thought about it-about time, though.
   So let's say that at some point Ilya switched to his own compositions. Yes, they seemed to him incomplete, unfinished, a little ugly, but nevertheless they were a part of him and it was impossible to refuse them so easily. What's more, it was impossible to give them up at all.
   And the weasel began to play. He played "Hide and Seek with the Leaves" and "Morning Dream" and "The Seventh Day of Summer", and even his new riff, which nobody had heard yet. This riff was not the most cheerful, even, perhaps, the most lyrical of Ilya's repertoire, whose music was always characterized by positivity and lightness.
   But this composition, this composition was calm, measured and even somewhat philosophical. The composition, in which there was so much that it was difficult to choose a name, but the young man coped with it. And now on the cipher paper (in fact, on the music records) it was called "The Last Cigarette". It was probably the stupidest name one could think of for such a riff, but Ilya thought that it suited the music very well.
   And again - at some point the music faded away. The last tones faded away, the echoes and the distant echoes faded away. The concert was given and finished, and together with its end, the third one fell asleep, waiting for the moment when he would not need neither the Prince nor the Ugly. He fell asleep, sinking into beautiful dreams, not available to anyone else.
   There was silence in the office for some time, and Ilya awaited the verdict with genuine excitement.
   - It's definitely yours, Ilya. One day, everyone will admit it.
   Ilya smiled and nodded his head. It was already getting dark outside the window. Snow crystals glimmered in the moonlight, pure silver, and it looked as if the forest and the edge of the forest were covered in a metallic film, or maybe it was the work of a giant jeweler.
   - Thank you, Ilya," said the professor, alluding to the concert.
   He hesitated, then smiled piratically and raised his hat.
   - You're welcome, Professor. Absolutely nothing.
   Flitwick smiled and glanced at his watch.
   - Uh-oh-oh. Young man, we've stayed too long with you, and you have a holiday to get ready for.
   - Oh, shit! Um... excuse me sir, I have to run!
   Ilya flew through the classroom like a hurricane - he put his guitar away, took his bag, washed and wiped his hands. Then he ran to the door and opened it eagerly, but, as it often happened, Filius called out to him.
   - All the best to you, future King of Rock - Ilya.
   Weasel froze and looked at the old man, who was behaving too strangely today.
   - See you later, Professor," the young man said.
   Filius Flitwick never showed up for Christmas dinner.
   
   
   
   
   
   January 2, 1994 England, Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
   Ilya, wrapped in a blanket, his legs propped up, was sitting on the couch in front of the blazing fireplace. On his lap lay a voluminous book about one of the most famous pirates. Ilya had just gotten to the point where this most famous corsair had been hired by the Queen to lead her fleet into battle against the Armada Invincible. Ilya, from general erudition, knew how the story would end, but still he read with genuine enthusiasm. At times he even dreamed of those times. Free gentlemen, living for the moment, refined ladies in fancy dresses, knowledgeable in poetry, music and dance. Feasts, battles, intrigue, love... Yes, it was a beautiful time, if you look at the books, of course... Well, romantic allusions aside, Ilya was, perhaps, happy to have been born at that time and in that era. 
   - No, your cat ate my poor Shorty! - Ron yelled.
   Didn't they tell you? No? I apologize for that oversight-Ilya was sitting in the lions' living room. The scarlet ones had the most people staying for the holidays, and they were the warmest. The whole castle was warm, though, compared to the dank, icy dungeons.
   Looking at Ginger and Danger, who had found a second reason to fight (the first being that Starter had ratted out Potter's Lightning to her dean), Ilya still wished he'd gone back in time. And there, in that come-as-you-book past, a self-respecting gentleman wouldn't yell at a lady. He would simply pretend that the lady did not exist.
   - It's your own fault! You didn't look after your rat! And Bellybutton didn't eat her, she just ran away from such a host!
   And the lady would never have shouted back. She would have covered herself with a fan and stepped aside. After all, shouting was not worthy of an unquestionably beautiful lady. Of course Granger wasn't unquestionably beautiful, and she wasn't just beautiful, either, but she did consider herself a lady.
   In fact, Ilya, from the smell, realized that the cat clearly hadn't eaten a rat, and in fact had been living on the usual exceptions for a long time, but was in no hurry to reveal this mystery. Weasley and Granger's scolding had a dual impact. In some ways it was really annoying, but on the other, it was quite amusing, and somehow it dispelled the boredom.
   For a while Ilya waited for Potter to join in the verbal altercation, but he, as usual, remained neutral. He sat quietly on the sidelines, leafing through a photo album. He'd even forgiven Danger for snitching about his Christmas present, a broomstick. Potter had gotten himself the fastest, best sports broom in the world, the Lightning, which was still only in "beta-testing" stage. That is, the prototype was not just difficult, but almost impossible to get, even scary to imagine how much it cost. However, the release was announced for May of this year...
   But don't think that Ilya was in no way jealous of Ochkarik. He had a Dror, not as fast, but much more maneuverable. Besides Ilya earned this broom by his own forces, persistently training for some years, even breaking the school schedule. And, believe me, what you get with your own sweat, pain and sometimes even blood is much closer to your heart than any gift.
   - I don't want that animal in my living room anymore!
   - This is not your living room! And the Bellybutton will walk wherever he wants!
   Ilya couldn't hear any further arguments because he... fell asleep. Yes, yes, just fell asleep. In the midst of winter, Ilya wanted to sleep even far away from the Forest. And this time he had no reason to resist the desire. Weasel fell asleep and had a strange dream in which he and Flitwick sat in his study, drinking tea, dangling his feet in the air as he had done long ago, when growth still allowed it, and telling silly things, while Flitwick smiled as if it was all very interesting to him... Or maybe he really was.
   
   
   
   
   
   January 26, 1994 England Hogwarts
    
    
    
    
   The vacation flew by at the speed of a fighter jet, leaving behind only an audible clap. For the most part, Ilya spent the whole time working, reading, listening, or playing music. Of course he also trained in the den, performing Animagic rituals, but that was more of a daily routine and didn't require any token of attention. Ilya had also been soaking his gifts for a while. Dumbledore had given him a set of false beards and moustaches. Ilya tried them all on, but found the most suitable one to be an espagnolo. So Ilya decided on how he would shave. Well, Flitwick made a royal gift, literally and figuratively. He gave him an Elvis record from the very first issue. And it was signed. It is frightening to imagine how much such a thing was worth among Muggle collectors. At the very least, a fortune.
   Ilya, not believing his eyes at first, ran to put Filch on the spear. The janitor, you can be sure, did not even understand what's what. But by the evening Weasel had acquired a glazed frame, in which he inserted the vinyl. Such a thing can not be stored casually, but you can put on a loss, well... only if the end of the world is coming and really need to burn out for the last time.
   Ilya measured his height after the holidays and realized that he had stretched himself even further in six months. Now, according to his calculations, at sixteen he would be in his twenties, if not more. It was alarming, even disturbing, but since it was a mystery-free year, Ilya didn't worry about it.
   What was unpleasant was that the first lesson after the holiday was with, who would you think - right, the Iron Lady. She, having rested during this time from Weasel, took to him with renewed vigor. Already from the first minutes of the lecture Ilya was exposed to an artillery bombardment of some tricky questions on a very confusing subject. That semester, the third year lions and snakes, ahead of the program, finished transmutations and now began the summoning of things. Do you have any idea how steep it is to create from nothing at least a box of matches? And how many formulas, calculations, rules and definitions are there? No, read a textbook on transfiguration and you'll find out! In general, it is surprising that Ilya managed to get as many as ten points for his vague answers. But nothing, Professor Flitwick is on vacation, but he will be back soon, and Ilya will show how to score points for complete, detailed answers, on clearly posed questions.
   Ilya was soaking wet with brainstorming that he flopped back down at his desk with relish. Granger snorted, as she always did, and immediately reached for the ceiling with her hand. It didn't take McGonagall long and immediately lifted her minion from her seat. Apparently the Dean of Scarlet was upset that she had to give out points to Slytherin. So now she was intent on pouring stones into her own faculty clock as well.
   - Miss Granger, tell us about the vector orientation of the materialization of a physical object.
   Wisely worded question, with the simplest answer - the object is formed from the bottom up. McGee likes everything to be scientific, to chew on the terms with his heel.
   Danger was about to answer when the doors opened and the one who had not been expected showed up on the threshold. There was an instant silence in the classroom as everyone could make out the figure of Albus Dumbledore in the doorway. The headmaster was unusually collected, calm and even a little businesslike, which automatically alarmed every student... and the teacher, too.
   - Mr. Ilya," said Dumbledore sternly. - Follow me, please.
   - Director! - Ilya jumped to his feet and applied his most innocent face. - Honestly it wasn't me. People are all lying. I wasn't there at all! Slander! I want a lawyer and....
   - A jury trial, yes, yes, I know. You're not being accused of anything, my boy.
   - But then...
   - Ilya, please, let's go and let's not delay the lesson.
   Ilya, realizing that something really serious is going on, gathered his things and with the whispers of students and their glances, went out.
   - Professor McGonagall," the Great Light Mage nodded.
   - Headmaster," the Dean of Scarlet nodded in response and turned to the crowd. - Class, let's get on with it.
   The doors closed and Ilya adjusted his hat. He used to rub his bandana tails when he was worried, now he adjusted his hat. These were gestures beyond his control; he didn't even notice them, which was not the case with the others.
   - Mr. Ilya, I have some sad news for you. I would ask you to pull yourself together and be courageous and strong in such a difficult hour, but you have always amazed me with your fortitude.
   - What is it, sir?
   - Ilya, my boy, it pains me to say this, but...
