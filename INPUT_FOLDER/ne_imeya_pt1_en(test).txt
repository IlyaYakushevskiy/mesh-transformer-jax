      Ilya, if he could, would have cut off his head, if only not to make the ogre nervous. But the advice came in handy; they were just passing through a crevice, and in a moment there was a sigh of admiration across the water. There, on the cliff, stood a castle. It glowed with the lights of stained-glass windows, numerous towers burst to the sky, and the ancient stonework seemed to remember the earliest wizards. Ancient and majestic, beautiful and airy, an abode for wizards and a school for wizards. A living dream for any child who has ever picked up a fantasy. Yes, it will be a thrill to study in one, but of course, it is a must explore. How many secret passages these walls hold, how many secrets are buried in the dust and consigned to oblivion. It seems Ilya will have a lot to do for the next seven years.    Soon the boats docked at the shore, and the children climbed up a ladder carved in the stone. The boat dock remained far below and became a blurred brown dot. Perhaps in a couple of years, if Illyspice wants to impress a lady, the best solution would be to sneak up here at night and steal one of the dinghies away. So much for an uncomplicated recipe for a date of the highest order.    The freshmen were led through a small alley, which had a fountain in the centre and was flanked by columns, then the central gate, now open to the open, was passed, then the main gate and here was the ni in the hall. Yes, it was like a portal to the Middle Ages. In the corners of the knights' armor, polished to a mirror shine, on the walls of the paintings, stretching in rows to the ceiling, marble steps and torches, for some reason not smoking the masonry. The giant, leaving the children in proud solitude, departed in an unknown direction. Ilya cringed once more. If this behemoth has ninja skills, then the question of survival is seriously complicated. He might have to apply all the science so thoroughly absorbed with blood on the streets of Skary Square. But all thoughts faded away that hour as ghostly figures began to pass through the walls, floating through the air. A ghost. A God. A soul. A mother. They were real ghosts. There was music playing in Illya's head, and someone shouted the cherished "Ghostbusters." Yeah, those guys would come in handy right now.   - Is that your toad? - There was a stern voice.   - Trevor! - shouted the chubby boy and dashed for the stairs.    - My name is Professor McGonagall, and I am the Vice Principal, Dean of Gryffindor, and Transfiguration teacher-as with all schools, there was likely to be a shortage of staff here. - You will now proceed to the Great Hall, where your placement will take place. The faculty you have chosen will be your home for the next seven years. You will eat, sleep and study together. Points will be awarded to the whole department for successes and for infractions and failures you will be dismissed from the whole department. At the end of the year a summary will be made and the winning faculty will be awarded the School Cup. This is a very honorable award everyone should strive for. Now, get ready.    Ilya did not learn anything new for himself. As he lived in the dorms, he will continue to live in the dorms. And life in the dorm is dangerous and interesting. Dangerous because you're only responsible for yourself, and teachers as always do not know and half of what is happening inside, but children are often cruel and merciless. In short, the zoo is a joke, and here everyone is armed. It's a hell of a place, Scary seems to be holding his breath. It's no wonder mages survived the Inquisition, because they're tougher than most wolves, beaten by life. You have to be smart here, turn on the Red Button, so to speak.    Soon, the doors of the hall opened and the children entered the ancient dirge in steady formation, as if on march. Again a whistle of delight swept through the newcomers. Amazing enchanted ceiling, not simply displaying, but as if being this very sky, captured the imagination. Under the dome floated black clouds, the stars shone clear and the moon peeked out from time to time. Candles were floating in the air, and everything was pervaded with a sense of real fairy tale. In total there were four tables in the hall. Each with its own colors and under its own flag. And near the northern wall, there was a fifth one, at which the professors sat, there were not few of them, but to cope with nearly four hundred students... Perhaps discipline, for the most part, was held back precisely by the fear of workouts and points taken off. Clever, I'll give you that.    A mantle rustled past, and a chair on which lay an ancient pointed hat was brought to the dais in front of the lecturer's desk. McGonagall stood beside it, holding a scroll in her hands. At first nothing happened, and then the hat began to... ...singing. She was actually pretty good at it, considering she couldn't have an ear or vocal cords, but apparently before thousands of years of experience, even that was nothing.    - Now, I'm going to read out your names. When you hear yours, come and sit on the stool and put on your hat.   In words, nothing complicated. But to subject his brain to probing, Ilya did not really want to.    - Abbott Hannah!   A slightly unkempt girl with a chubby face stepped forward and put on her headdress with trembling hands.   - Hufflepuff!" the piece of matter shouted.    The girl shrieked happily, put her hat on the stool, and rushed to the table below the badger emblem. The whole room applauded, except for the Slytherins, but the badgers themselves applauded the loudest. And then there was it. Most people went either to the lions or to the badgers. Which is, you know, comical, because it's either a brave man or a simpleton. Though, in the history of Hogwarts, it was said that badgers are distinguished by loyalty to family and friends, but often it is perceived by society as stupidity and naivety. That's where the curiosity about dumb Hufflepuffs came from. There was also the curious fact that if someone sat down with snakes, only the snakes clapped, and the hall cringed contemptuously. Apparently they did not like green colors in their clothes. Ilya himself did not care what emblem to wear.   - Ilya Ilya!    I think it's a good idea that I'm not going to be able to do this, but I'm sure I'm going to be able to do it. Yeah, here we go again. Tricks from the guys, giggling and winking girls, squeezing older girls who see him as nothing more than a plush toy. But there are definitely perks. You can even now. Ilya applied the skill "smiling face", directing all its power to the deputy director... The effect was equal - a splash. She looked at him a stern metallic look and pointed to the stool. The steel lady, apparently also with balls. Perhaps not everything is so simple in the Danish kingdom and will have to spend a few more days at the mirror working on strengthening the "muzzle".    - Very curious.   - Who's there?! - frightened the boy.   - Don't shout, young man, I'm not deaf," Ilya could now distinguish a disgruntled female voice.   &shy;-Are you a hat? &shy;-the naive Chukchi youth asked.   - How rude to point out another person's shortcomings. Yeah, I'm a hat.   - Uh, excuse me ma'am, uh, ma'am, I mean miss, arh - mrs.   A cheerful laugh rang in the boy's head.   - Calm down, my boy, I'm not going to, as you naively believe, burn through your brain.   - All right, then.   - Well, now that that's sorted, I suppose we should get on with the distribution. Intelligence, yes, I see. I see sharp intelligence, I see courage, but most of all I see love and loyalty, you've been told that, right? But I'm sorry, my boy, you'd be perfect for Hufflepuff if it weren't for your desire to be strong. And maybe if you were a pureblood wizard, you could embody it in the Badger Faculty.   - How did you know I was a Muggleborn? - He suddenly perked up. - Did you know my parents?   - No, but I can see them in you. Didn't you know? Our loved ones are always there, they live in our hearts and memories, helping in times of need.    - Where do you look then, the heart or the memory?   And there's that tinkling, girlish laugh again.   - Yes, the raven-haired goblin will chew his elbows off when he finds out how smart you are and that you didn't get into Ravenclaw. No, boy, I'm not going to tell you exactly where I'm looking, I'm not going to deprive you of another mystery. But I see you want to know about your parents. Well, we've taken up enough of our time talking, so let them wait a few more minutes. Your mother was a beautiful woman. Beautiful inside and out, which, believe old hat, is a rare combination. She was kind and loving and compassionate, but naive and trusting. And God forbid, she certainly wasn't a whore. But, as you may have guessed by now - she was a Muggle.   - And the father?   The hat was silent for a while.   - He wasn't a magician. I'd tell you more, though, kid, but I can feel the tension in the room, and people are hungry while we're talking. Now, like I said, if you were a pureblood, maybe you'd be good at Hufflepuff. But now... No, if you're hungry for power, you belong in another department. But I'm warning you, it's going to be difficult, very difficult.   - I can do it!   - Slytherin! - Shouted the hat.   There were distinctly disappointed sighs from girls in the hall, which were thinned out by sighs of joy, also girlish. Ilya took off his hat, brushed the dust off it, and put it on the stool. For a moment he met McGonagall's gaze and in her eyes he saw the strongest concern, almost fear, though he probably just imagined it. Turning back to the snaky faculty, gathering all his courage in his fist, and exhorting himself that he was already a shot sparrow and a bunch of pampered aristocrats would not be frightened, Ilya walked his Green Mile. When he sat in an empty seat, he had to shake a few hands, respond to a couple of smiles, and only then was the guy left alone. Just behind him, the same white-haired homo was walking towards the stool. Before the hat could even fall on his head, the Slytherin was already shrieking rabidly, as if afraid to touch his pumpkin. Understandably so... While the boy, shining like a scrubbed toilet bowl, stomped over to the table, Ilya looked at the teachers' table. Each, as a choice, was more colorful than the other. There was a man in a turban with an unhealthy glint in his eyes, a greasy-haired bastard (Ilya had learned to tell bastards apart in his eleven years in Scary Square), a kindly dwarf in a pince-nez, a chubby-looking old lady, and a bunch of other muffins. But on the largest and most decorated stool sat Dumbledore. When they met eyes, the Headmaster raised his right eyebrow questioningly, in response Ilya simply shrugged and received an approving nod. The mute dialogue was over, the consensus was achieved, the meeting was declared closed, please go to the gully.    - Hi, my name is Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy, and what are your parents' names.   Ilya was about to choke on air. Maybe, just maybe, even children of mages have their own quirks. He was either trying to make a move, or he really thought it was more important to know the names of their parents.   - Me," Ilya emphasized that word. - My name is Ilya, and I have no idea about my parents.   And the second those fateful words were spoken, the entire Slytherin table turned toward Ilya as if on cue. Perhaps they were trying to hypnotize him, or to embarrass him, but Mr. Ilya, even the women's bath couldn't embarrass him; on the contrary, it was fun.   - What do you mean, you have no idea? - Some tall guy with a badge for a headman asked.   - Funny - life has its upsets. I got this one. I've never seen my ancestors in my life.   - So you...   - Yeah, I'm an orphan.    A silence fell over Slytherin, broken by the white-haired man, who suddenly moved abruptly away and wrinkled his nose like it was a pile of shit.   - Mudblood," he hissed.   Strangely, Ilya thought that word would really offend him, or hurt him in some way, but... no, nothing like that. And along with the homo, the others moved away, and in five minutes a zone of exclusion was created around the guy and he simply ceased to be noticed, though the occasional cast glances in his direction, promised a cheerful life. But the boy in particular didn't like the way the greasy-haired man looked at him. With a touch of apprehension, a little hint of contempt, and just a ton of superiority. It seems that Ilya has found that very teacher that everyone has, that teacher who is easier to kill than to pass a test, or even worse - an exam. That teacher, with whom he was on edge from the first second of acquaintance. But philosophy is philosophy, and you're hungry. That's why when Dumbledore waved his hands and the table broke with food, Ilya pounced on the food like a starving wildcat, which is what he was. There was scornful whispering and snorting all around. They were aristocrats, eating like they were at Her Majesty's reception, with a fork in their mouths and a bit of food you could draw in through their nostrils. No wonder that in Ilya's neighborhood food ran out with astonishing speed, and the hungriest had to ask to pass it from the other end of the table. But at the moment Ilya didn't care much about that. As they say in the shelter - you have to eat once, for a week in advance, because who knows when you'll get another meal. And now, snacking on partridge, escalope and some kind of sausage at the same time, Ilya was washing it all down with orange, tomato and apple juice. One after the other, of course. However, he had a worthy competitor: some red-haired lad from the vultures' table, sharpening at such a rate that even Cavin could not argue with him, and he was a good eater.    When it came to dessert, Ilya was ready to howl, there was almost no room left in his stomach. But that didn't mean the kid lost. On the contrary, he unbuttoned a button on his tattered jeans, and with a second breath in him, he pounced on the cream cake, pouring gallons of hot chocolate into himself, not as delicious as Fortescue's, but still. But all good things come to an end sometime, and free food all the more so. When many people were already mellowing, and Ilya couldn't even fit a piece of bouche (p.a. who doesn't know - a pastry like that), Dumbledore waved his hands again, annihilating the food and asked the headmen to take the people to their living rooms. Ilya, panting and panting through his breath, somehow got up and hurried after the stream of his new classmates. Right now, all he could dream of was a soft bed, a blanket that wasn't too shabby, and a pillow of some kind.    The Slytherins descended the stone stairs into the dark dungeons, where, despite the warmth, a cold breeze sometimes ran through, forcing them to wrap themselves tightly in their robes. Already dormant portraits lined the walls, hissing at the students as the headmasters shone Lumos in their eyes. The path among the winding corridors and intricately woven twists and turns was firmly fixed in Ilya's mind, on a full stomach, it thought just fine. The procession stopped near the wall, between two tapestries, the seventh-year headman stepped forward and said:   - Excellence.   At the same second, the wall flickered and turned transparent. Gentlemen students piled briskly into the living room. It was even cozy in here. Many tables surrounded by comfortable armchairs upholstered in green chintz, a couple of wide sofas facing each other, a blazing fireplace, around which there were four (obviously elite) sofas, designed for maximum two. Somewhere in the far distance, one could see stairs, and beyond them, a long corridor divided into two arms. And a fool was clear - the right one, for girls. Yawning, Ilya sat down on a chair, no strength and no desire to stand. Sleep, like a cat of prey, crouched down and prepared for a swift leap.   - Get out," someone hissed nearby. When he opened his eyes, Draco Malfoy was instantly identified in the smudged blur. - Get out, you scum, I'm not going to sleep in the same room as a lousy filthy girl.   The homie was echoed by consonant voices, the situation was heating up, and Ilya was taken in by disgruntled custodians of blood purity. In short, the aristocrats had been stepped on their favorite nerve.    - I don't fancy living next to a faggot either," Ilya shrugged, clutching his knife in the pocket of his robes.    - Oh, you!" Malfoy snatched up his wand and pointed it right in Ilya's face. He was ready to test the wizard's belly with his butterfly.    - Mr. Malfoy," someone said quietly, but very, how should I say, bloodily, even more like "bloodily promising.   There was an immediate silence in the living room. The appearance of the greasy-haired man caused quite a furor. The ex-gop-stoppers and criminals, pretending to be hamsters, squeezed a point-sized point. It seems, Ilya decided, that this guy is a local authority. And in general the personality of the man, with a hunched long nose, stern expression, smirk smirk, black robe, resembling the folded wings of a bat, inspired a kind of healthy apprehension. One should be more careful with such a person.    - Mr. Malfoy, I will not tolerate any infighting in my department," and he also happens to be the Dean. By the way, no one dared argue with the man. An authority indeed. - Isn't it enough that everyone and everything in this castle is against Slytherin? Do you want a little internal strife as well? I warn you, anyone seen harassing a fellow student will know the full extent of my displeasure. I hope you haven't forgotten the basic Slytherin principles yet? If so, refresh them overnight, because as of tomorrow morning, I hope to see you in better shape than you are now. Now, I urge you all to go to bed. The wardens, report to me in the morning for the schedule.    I was in the middle of the corridor, and the prospect of falling asleep in the middle of the corridor was not a pleasant one. But there was nothing to do, we had to go, and besides, to fall asleep in the middle of the corridor was not a very pleasant prospect. At first glance, there weren't many freshmen at the Green. Four guys, not counting Ilya, and four girls. Nine people in all. They walked down the corridor in silence, but Ilya could literally feel the disgruntled glances of his classmates burning through his back. By the way, most of the elders remained sitting in the living room, apparently in the morning someone will have a bad headache... and the luckiest have a pleasant whine a little lower. Ilya even chuckled, everything was the same as in the orphanage, nothing had changed.    The freshman's room commanded respect. Five four-poster beds, five wardrobes, as many bedside tables and shelves. There was a trunk beside each bed, and a guitar case by Ilya's bed. Ilya scratched his head and did not find an answer to the question how they had found out exactly how many guys would be admitted to the department, when they had time to bring their things and much more. Just as strange was the presence of windows overlooking the Forbidden Forest. Ilya could have sworn that they had gone down deep enough and there could not be any windows at all.    Quickly undressed and threw clothes on the best rack in the world - a chair, Ilya climbed on the featherbed (!), covered himself with a warm (!), soft (!) blanket, twisted on a clean (!) sheet, lay down on a feather (!) pillow and fell asleep almost immediately.   - Watch your back, filthy girl," the cockerel sang, as it wasn't hard to guess. - Snape won't always have your back.    - Oh, fuck you," the former leader of Scary Square's youngest gang was unable to finish as Morpheus picked him up in his caring arms and carried him off into a world of air castles and free hot dogs. Chapter 3   October 1, 1991. Hogwarts.      October 30, 1991. Hogwarts.       Brown, a pretty girl with bright, brown eyes and an already imposing figure, made a praying face. But the head nerd was adamant.    - No," Granger cut her off, unhappy that she'd been dragged into this childishness. - I wasn't.   - Okay," Brown shook her head sadly, but all the girls beside her noticed her smiling. - If you lose, you lose.   The girl came up on her tiptoes and was about to kiss the boy on the cheek, but Ilya turned abruptly on his heels and kissed him on the lips. It didn't last long, but the boy was pleased with the unsophisticated prank. But after a moment someone else's sharp fist bumped into his ribs.   - Fool!" shouted a blushing Brown, whose eyes, however, shone with obvious pleasure at the little prank.    The boys looked at the Slytherin with obvious envy, and Draco with disdain, underneath which the same envy was firmly lurking. The girls looked at Brown with envy, though Hermione didn't seem to care about anything that wasn't directly related to studying and doing her homework.    - Maybe now you won't snore in class," the honors student commented on the situation.   - I don't snore," Ilya said indignantly. - But don't expect me to do that again. Even kissing all the girls at school won't make me torture my poor, weak body like that," Ilya faked a sob and then straightened up, took off his illusory hat and bowed. - I bow to you my lady, your resilience is unmatched. Bing's spell slips off you like water off a duck's back.   - Poseur," Granger snorted, and hugging her transfiguration textbook as if it were the tablets of the covenant, she headed down the corridor, her stride distinctly measured.   The people, some laughing, some whispering, followed. There was a short break between the first lessons, just enough time to get to the next classroom, and no one wanted to be late for the Iron Lady. Brown, shooting her eyes at Ilya, who was already regretting the little gamble, caught up with her friend, one of the Patil twins, and giggling, disappeared around the corner. Ilya was left alone next to the office, where the ghost professor was flying around in circles, muttering something under his ghostly nose. No one was waiting for Ilya. Despite the fact that he was everyone's favorite, he never made any friends. And he regretted the venture, because now Brown would think up all sorts of things and then there would be problems, whispers and so on. Perhaps next week, he should spend more time in the library in his class. Picking up his bag, and with a customary gesture of tucking his wand behind his belt, Ilya headed for transfiguration class, remembering on the way.    The first week was the most, how should I say, overwhelming. By the next morning, Ilya, sitting at his faculty table in that very alienation zone, began to strongly doubt the sanity of wizards. What else could it be? No sooner had he eaten his oatmeal, than owls began to fly in the window. Well, they would bring mail after supper, but not during the process of ingestion. What if they pee, or shit, right on the plate? Anyway, at least the kid got his present. Dumbledore, along with a huge bird, sent him a book with the mysterious title "Numerology, Make your own spell. But the goodies didn't end there, there was a second book in the parcel. It was not so large, only three hundred pages, and was called "The Runes". And in the enclosed letter, Dumbledore explained that the two works must not be read separately, otherwise it would be a Sisyphean task. He thanked the kindly Daedan with a happy smile and a nod of his head as he quietly raised his glass to show his thanks were acknowledged. But the boy was not destined to begin his study. First, as he opened the book, he saw a huge figure. It took him ten feet of parchment, two ink cans, and a lot of time to comprehend just the first chapter. And he only memorized three formulas and solved only two assignments. In general, the subject turned out to be very interesting, but complicated. So he decided not to rush, to go slowly, and in the third year to take Numerology and Ancient Runes as additional subjects.   However, there was another reason. Because there was not a single soul in the department who did not crave the immediate death of a "lousy filthy girl", the boy, so as not to exacerbate the situation and not to get in the way, all his free time spent in the library. There he read the rare fiction found on the shelves, and various textbooks, which mentioned in his lectures professors. Well, the lectures at first stunned the boy, and then upset him. He thought that, sitting in a room in the Hollow Cauldron, he would come and immediately shit himself in practice, but where was the practice and where were the freshmen. When the first lectures in literally every subject were devoted to safety, Ilya began to realize that something was wrong. Then, however, he began practicing Potions, never being boring thanks to the good-natured Neville, ready to blow up the cauldron at the first request of the higher powers. And also thanks to the fact that the greasy-haired bastard couldn't pass up a chance to put Potter down. When Potter gnawed at him about his talentlessness, stupidity and feeble mindedness, Ilya laughed softly to himself, no, not out of spite, but simply because he was using very sarcastic and biting language. But when he began to smear the dead father of the bespectacled boy, Ilya howled softly, again to himself. No, not out of pity for Potter, but simply because if the shaggy-haired boy were in an orphanage now, he'd get his guts kicked in, his teeth kicked in, and then buried upside down in a shit pit. That wasn't something even the most badass of the orphanage staff would allow themselves - parents were sacred, especially dead parents. No, Snape really was a complete and unconditionally complete bastard if he allowed himself such a thing. The only thing Ilya did not understand was how Potter could calmly tolerate it all. If Potter ever said anything like that to Ilya, he would instantly have a new hole in his gut. But time passed, and Snape kept a cold neutrality with Ilya. He didn't pester the boy, and the boy didn't cause any inconvenience or trouble.   He was also a bit of an oddball, but he had to be a bit of a jerk to get to the Quidditch team of his department. He was the envy of all the boys, young and old. Including Ilya. Ilya respected sports, and certainly the first flight on a broomstick has caused him a storm of emotions, the more so that Madame Trick noted his abilities in this case. Next was Traumology, where you just shouldn't yawn, or some especially zealous bush will bite your finger, or something more important. And for all these peripeteia, Ilya did not particularly notice that the lessons ZOTI, Transfiguration and Char, ni pass only the general theory and endlessly learning the basic sweeps of the wand. And also the correct pronunciation of some Latin roots and whole words. Why Hogwarts simply did not introduce a lesson in Latin, the boy never understood.   The month passed and it became clear that Ilya risked losing all his skills until the time of practice came. So he began to sneak out of the living room at night and make his way around to the abandoned classroom on the second floor, where he studied on his own. Mostly Transfiguration, since he was way behind in it. He would have been, if he'd woken up in the first half of September.    And on one such crossing, in mid-September, Ilya came across a couple making out, and it had to be said, very hard and enthusiastically making out. For example, the guy's robe and shirt had already come off, and the right strap of the girl's bra had long since slipped off her satin shoulder. From the immediate curse that was about to explode in the direction of Ilya, saved only that this pink-haired girl recognized the boy and stopped the heated boy in time. The lady turned out to be none other than the same waitress from Fortescue's Cafe. From that very moment the beginning of Ilya's emergence as the main darling of the school was laid.   It was gradual, but it started in that class. Then, Tonks, who didn't like to be called by her first name, instead of kicking out an unwanted spectator, started chatting with him. Then she brought him into the living room of her department, Hufflepuff. At first the badgers were indignant that it was a despicable slug doing in their abode, but as soon as the older girls entered, it began what Ilya had always feared - he was confused with a plush toy. For a couple of weeks, the older ladies dragged him to the badgers for a chat, a pat and a laugh. The boy didn't mind, he had to at least socialize with someone. Due to this close acquaintance with most of the Hufflepuffs, from fifth to seventh year, the boy became known amongst the male Badger population as well. You need to find out what your girlfriend wants, ask when it's best to ask that prude over there on a date, what flower to give her, when it's her birthday, or any other question - turn to Grabert Ilya, he will definitely answer. So Ilya became his boyfriend of the whole Badger faculty.   Then, somehow, by itself, the exact same process was set in motion in Ravenclaw tower, and then, just think, in Gryffindors too. And given that the boy sat in the library during the day and never refused to help anyone - whether it was a paper, an obscure topic, or a difficult homework, the youngsters began to treat the Slytherin with great warmth. It is a paradox of magic, no one in the castle loves Slytherins (to generalize), but everyone loves Ilya, and at the same time, no Slytherin knows this very Ilya, who became a national favorite by mid-October. Such preferences from his appearance and good memory, as well as politeness and kind smiles were not expected even by Ilya himself. True, there were discontented. For example, the same Weasel, who each time, seeing Ilya in his living room, hurried to make a scandal and eventually get away, dragging Potter with him. He was also terribly hated by the entire first year Slytherin class, who, by and large, were just jealous of him (at least, that was what Ilya thought).   Hermione Granger, too, was literally seething at the sight of Ilya, calling him a narcissistic poser. You see, she was unhappy that the boy often leafed through "tabloid fiction" in the library, and then managed to get better grades than "Miss I'm a genius". Often it happened that Ilya was sitting, leafing through some fantasy, and next ploughed Hermione and began demonstratively write an essay or do other homework. Admittedly, the boy felt sorry for the girl, she was also sort of an outcast in the adjoining department, and while Ilya could talk to almost anyone in the castle and was able to enter any circles, Granger could not boast of this. So Ilya, a wide-hearted and big-hearted man, never left Hermione until she was finally immersed in her work. He often poked her, teased her, and tried to cheer her up a little. When he was already literally thrown at him with fists - retired to one of the living room, allowing the girls to squeeze themselves and listen to another stream of news, gossip and other things. Thus, Ilya also found himself aware of all the Hogwarts backstabbing. Who sleeps with whom, who goes out with whom, who loves whom, who hates whom, who runs behind whom, and who does not notice who, all this was known to the darling and his boyfriend - Ilya.    There was one other person with whom relations did not work out. Ilya's "smarmy face" was brought to such skill that it worked even on Mrs. Norris (probably Chuck's relative, since she was feared by absolutely everyone), but Professor McGonagall was unapproachable. She disliked the boy for something. Ilya never raised his hand in class, didn't want to be compared to Hermione, but always answered if asked. He answered with sincerity, genuine interest and additions which were read out of books. The Prefects could not be pleased and often gave an inflated, but justly inflated score. But the Iron Lady, even if she asked the boy, which was very rare, gave him a maximum of ten. And the way she picked on his homework was already legendary. She even checked his spelling and punctuation, which professors never paid attention to. At first Ilya took offense, and tried with all his might to prove that he deserved a warmer attitude to his person. But it seemed that no matter what he did, the professor only disliked him more. So it was no surprise that the boy soon decided that there was no way to bury the problem, and therefore he could safely give it up. There was, however, one drawback: Animagia was so fascinating to the boy (a fan of the Tales could not pass up an opportunity to get close to his idol) that he literally howled, lamenting that he could not discuss the subject with McGee. All the literature on the subject, however, was kept in the Forbidden Section, and not even a "smiling face," could bend Madame Pince to open the cherished iron casement. Only a referral from the professor in charge of the subject. You get the idea yes - getting a referral from the Iron Lady was akin to something unbelievable.    As the days passed, Gryffindor had beaten Slytherin, and the next day there were rumors all over the castle that a certain slug was celebrating the victory of Scarlet in the living room of Scarlet. As a matter of fact, that was what it was - Ilya's little revenge on his faculty, if you could put it that way. It took only a month and a half for the freshman and sophomores to learn how to communicate normally with the handsome Slytherin. It broadened the horizons of communication. But there was still no practice. So it was boring. The boy had been out into the Forbidden Forest a couple of times, but Hagrid, who turned out to be a normal "boy", had been quick to find him there. He never knocked at the castle, and often drank strong chyffirk and treated him to battle stone muffins. The boy once participated in a prank on Gemini, but then admitted that such a spread wasn't for him. After this confession, the Twins respected the boy (George was always trying to sniff out something about Angelina Johnson). In general, life went on in its own, a little dull and unbearable way. The constant bickering between Malfoy and Co. and Potter and Ginger wasn't as much fun as it used to be. The constant snapping with Daphne Greengrass and her Latina friend Blaze Zabini (p.a. - yes, yes, I'm going to have Zabini as a girl, and a Latina, too) , is getting tiresome. By the way, it should be noted, Daphne was dazzlingly beautiful. And she was the only one who could talk normally to Ilya. Or rather, argue with Ilya. Snape, to his chagrin, put them in the pot at Pottery class. And here we go... "Dirty girl," "whore," "bastard," "bitch," and other not very flattering epithets and metaphors, were only a small part, at times very sophisticated bends of the two young people. However, this did not prevent them from brewing quite tolerable potions, Ilya, despite the fact that he could never get over his aversion to the subject, could not afford to fall face down in the mud and was forced to keep the bar high. And the bar was this - not lower than "P". So that was the life of an orphan boy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some would say that he was a cheese in butter, some would sympathize, but nevertheless, the world kept turning, in spite of everything.    But today, today was all about to change - practice was finally about to begin. Right now, yes, right now, when the bell rang, they would be practicing transmutation with McGee, tomorrow simple Charms with the deeply respected Ilya Flitwick, and tomorrow ZoT, with some beat-up Quirrell, whose lectures were impossible to listen to because he stuttered endlessly.    He was in the classroom, where everyone had already taken their seats. Contrary to the popular opinion that students sit in the front row, Ilya preferred the back row.   - You're late, Mr. Illya," McGonagall squeaked.   - Bom!" the bell tolled through the corridors.   - The school itself doesn't seem to agree with you," Ilya grinned rather nastily (practiced in front of the mirror).   - Don't hold up the lesson," the Iron Lady muttered. - Take your seat.   Ilya shrugged, and, to the laughter of the audience, made his way to the back of the classroom, where he sat all alone. Longbottom and Finigan snuggled to his left, and the right side was empty - the Slytherins were clearly holding the exclusion zone.   - So today we begin one of the fundamental topics of Transfiguration, which is the basis of all science," McGee recited from the pulpit, while on the blackboard behind her, a flying chalk was passionately scribbling the formula, the trajectories of wand sweeps, and so on and so forth. - Transmutation is the most important part, without mastering it, you can't make much progress in magic. Can someone tell me about transmutation of a material object?    The situation is a forest of hands. Only Greengrass and Granger were pulling. Why the blonde, named Daphne, had suddenly decided to show off her knowledge, Ilya did not know. He wasn't interested in that, if she wanted it, so be it.   - Mr. Crabbe, how about you?   The big, clumsy kid, who certainly didn't look twelve at first glance, stood up, maybe fifteen. The doughboy, with his round face and cold ears, glared at Malfoy, but the latter only waved him off.   - Um, well, transmutation, it's, uh, what's his...   - Sit down, Mr. Crabbe," the professor sighed wearily. - Mr. Weasley, would you.   The redhead, no small boy either, stood up and coughed. He always did that before he answered, maybe there was something wrong with his health?   - Transmutation is the transformation of one object, into another," Weasley chided.    Ilya hummed. That's like saying, an object falls down because it's heavy, or tomorrow will be tomorrow, because today is today. In short, Captain Hindsight, having rolled up his red cape, retires to a well-deserved rest, handing the hero's suit over to the redheaded lad suffering from mild intellectual clumsiness.   - Mr. Ilya, did Mr. Weasley say something funny? - literally hissed like a cat, the Iron Lady.   Ilya rose politely.   - No, I just remembered a joke.   - Share?    - Um, goblin, Wayla and the Dark Lord walk into a bar one day...   - Mr Ilya! Five points from Slytherin!   - You asked for it yourself," Ilya shrugged, ignoring the displeasure of the snake's fellow students.   - Well, if you took the time to read anecdotes in my class, maybe you can tell us about transmutation.   - Is that a question, or are you just suggesting?   - Question," McGonagall gritted her teeth, and at that moment Ilya could see the corners of her lips twitching.    It was obvious right away that she was up to no good. Surely if he answered like in the textbook, she would ridicule him and take away his points again, for breach of discipline. If he answered in his own words, the same thing. But Ilya would not have been a winner of the dreaded Perry Figelton, of the West Side, if he did not know how to find a way out of even stalemate situations.   - Oh, I'm so flattered, Professor, that you would ask me to speak about such an important art form," Ilya sniffed. - I think everyone," Ilya stressed the word. - It is known that transmutation is nothing but the transformation of atoms of one element into another as a result of radioactive decay of their nuclei.   The class fell out, even Granger, who had been reaching out all along, slowly let her hand go, gawking at the Slytherin. Ilya was deliberately putting emphasis on the word "all," trying to jab at the professor, but she was apparently reading Muggle science textbooks.   - Where did you get that from, Mr. Ilya? - The professor grumbled again. Maybe she's got a cramp in her jaw or something? We should call Madam Pomfrey.   Ilya himself, in the definition he had just uttered, did not understand a single word. If the professor asked him to explain even one term, it would be finita la comedy, and he would be lucky to get away with it. But the boy was accustomed to play for broke, bluffing at the same time and not having a single trump up his sleeve.    - In the textbook," the boy shrugged.   - The Hogwarts library has no Muggle physics textbooks!   Ilya could barely keep from smirking. The adults might be more experienced and smarter, but they're often very easy to catch, and all they have to do is make an innocent and confused face. Being a kid was so damn convenient.    - Did you just go off on the subject of me being a dirty girl, or did you just...   - Mr. Ilya! What do you think you're doing?! Minus forty...   - Before you take the points off me," Ilya interrupted the teacher for the first time in his life. - May I ask what for? For not recognizing, as you put it, "Muggle physics," for not agreeing with my definition, or for not liking me?   The temperature in the room had dropped noticeably. Everyone knew that there was a cold war going on between the Dean of the Lion Faculty and one first-year from Slytherin. Now the guys witnessed how the cold war had turned into an open confrontation, where, it seemed, there were no rules and laws, and to strike at the most hurtful. So Ilya struck. Clearly a follower of Dumbledore, the half-breed McGee would never insult Muggleborns and certainly belittle the merits of wizards, hence - the last option remains, to sign off on his bias. As Cavin used to say when playing poker with his elders - "you've only got one runner-up, but you'd better reset." And Ilya was sure - the Iron Lady would reset.   - I don't know what you've got in your head," the professor said calmly, but with a terrible twinkle in her eye. - Sit down, Mr. Ilya, thirty points for Slytherin.   Ilya did not escalate the situation with his trademark witticisms, but simply sat back down. That's what he understood, walked on the blade, tickled the lion, nerves on edge, hands trembling, sweat hailing down his back - finally something interesting. After a short pause, the professor started her rant, which Ilya didn't really listen to, he had read and understood everything already in summer. No, Ilya was preparing, preparing for a terrible revenge for two months of humiliation and belittling from the Dean of Alosnamese. If he wanted her so badly, he might as well go to war with her. In the end, he would only risk being stripped of his grades and workouts, at the very least, a label of upstart. But the professor herself would be forced to put her reputation on the line. And since Ilya had no false illusions and knew that in the end he would lose, he decided to bluff his way to the end of the war with just one battle. After which the surrendered side either recognizes the victor, or lurks, waiting for the opportune moment for revenge. But the latter is more characteristic of snakes than of lions.    - Miss Granger, would you please hand out the study material," was the dean's clever way of calling matches. - Three per person.   The girl obediently rose from her seat and began handing out "study material. When she approached the Slytherins, they scurried away from her like a dung fly and looked at the matches placed on their desks as if they were dung. The Gryffindors, on the other hand, simply ignored her. Hermione's lips were already trembling and her eyes were wet as she approached Ilya. Either McGee was practicing the wedge method of pedagogy, or she was too old and already blind.   - Thank you," Ilya whispered, taking the matches. The girl nodded at him and went off to her room.   You'd probably think Ilya was too much of a non-Slytherin Slytherin, and you'd be right, just remembering their conversation with the hat. Ilya had too big of a heart, apparently inherited from his mother, according to that hat.    - So, all of you hopefully remembered the right sweeps and the formula for the spell, so please try it.    Immediately the air whistled, dissected by precise and not-so-precise sweeps, the whispers of the formulas being uttered could be heard walking around the classroom. Ilya himself, had stumbled across "Nonverbal" spells in a gifted work. Naturally he became interested in them, went to the library, got the material and bang. A month and a half of work and no effect. And what was the boy's disappointment when he noticed that even the strongest mage had enough strength for a non-verbal style of witchcraft only after fourteen. And an average one only by fifteen or sixteen. That's a prime example of Sisyphus' work. So Ilya, like the others, pointed his wand at the matches and recalled the simplest formula. He, with a habitual effort, dispersed the heat through his body, directing it to the wand, and then did three times and three times said the formula. On the table lay three needles. They were nice and neat. But even that made Ilya cringe, he had already mastered the mass in spells - that is, one Leviosa several items, but the Transfiguration... That was clearly not his path. He is not so good at this as he is often tired and exhausted, as mages have their limits. But enough with the lyrics, the party wasn't waiting.   - Professor," the reckless lad raised his hand. - Can I have another match?   McGonagall looked away from her papers and... She looked at the student with surprise.   - Broken already? - she asked.   - Already transmuted.   There was silence in the room that hour, and everyone stopped working, which saved Neville from getting his eye poked out because Seamus was waving his wand so jealously. Everyone was staring at Ilya in a daze, no, they knew he was a straight A student and everything, but there was a rumor that Ilya was more of a crammer than Granger and only good in theory. The Iron Lady seemed to be of that opinion. She shot up from her seat, glided between the desks with feline grace, and was beside the boy. The boy flinched at the pressure. The professor adjusted her famous horn-rimmed glasses, and picked up the first of the needles. She was examining it so closely that one would have thought she was looking for traces of a dark-magical artifact in this figurine. The other needles suffered the same fate.   - Five points to Slytherin," the professor said, and then with an audible creak of her heart she added. - For excellence in witchcraft.   But it wasn't over yet.   - Five points for each? - with an innocent smile, Ilya asked.   - Yes, five points each," the professor hissed grudgingly.   - And another twenty-five for being the first to do it, and in such a short time.   - Yes, and two more... Mr. Ilya! What do you think you're doing? We're not at a fair to haggle.   - I'm sorry," Ilya shook his head crushingly, and applied his new invention of the "suffering face. The power of that face was so great that Professor Sprout nearly drowned him in her chamomile tea. Even McGonagall was pierced, with universal guilt reflected in her eyes for a second.   - And twenty-five points to Slytherin," she said on an exhale. - For being the first.   - Thank you," Ilya smiled. He smiled sincerely. The war, at least for the near future, was over. - Can I go now, Professor?   - Yeah, go ahead. You don't need to write anything on the subject of transmutation.   That concluded the dialogue. Ilya gathered up his textbooks, closed the inkwell, flicked all this splendor into his bag, and walked through a row of students looking at him with seven shades of all kinds of feelings. Some with disdain, some with respect, a couple with obvious boredom, one with terrible envy. What was odd was that this certain envious one was not Hermione Granger, but Ronald Weaselmon, or whatever his name was. He seemed ready to curse the bloody slug if he knew a single curse. And as for the girl nerd, when the boy walked past her, she looked at him with a strange doubt. Ilya didn't know, but five minutes after he'd left the classroom, there were three silver matches lying in front of the owner of the auburn mane.    Ilya, on the other hand, left the study, yawned, and headed for the library, where the adventures of Drizzt Do'Urden awaited him. No, Ilya was adamant that wizards could never write as well as Muggles. They were simply too familiar with magic to be able to come up with the most miraculous magic.      * * *       Ilya dotted the letter and reached out, and after a couple of moments, put the letter into his bag, to put it in his trunk, where there was a pile of the same ones. Alas, these letters were not destined to see the addressee. Ilya, once a week, four Fridays a month, wrote letters to his friends in which he described everything that had happened to him in the past few days. Perhaps it was a kind of diary, describing not only events but also light shades of feelings. Still, Ilya hoped that one day he would be able to show them to his friends, and together they would laugh at the curiosities of the life of a schoolboy wizard.    Ilya closed the inkpot, winked at the flock of sophomores at the next table, and hurried out of the library. The castle was unusually lively today. The atmosphere at Hogwarts was always bright and boiling, but today, on Halloween Day, everyone was really buzzing. And Ilya himself was also on edge, firstly, today was the first day of practical charms, and secondly, in the evening a real feast was waiting for him. And to have a tasty meal, especially for free (the tuition was paid by the foundation) Ilya was always no fool. So, while the juniors were finishing their lessons and the seniors were completing the decoration of the Great Hall and the corridors of the first floor, the tension and anticipation was felt everywhere.   The Chars room, like most of the practical magic rooms, was located on the second floor and partially overlooked the Quidditch Field and the Forbidden Forest. In fact, the entire second floor faced the Quidditch pitch and the edge of the forest. Finding a crowd of students, waiting in front of the door, Ilya realized that not only he was so eager to apply their knowledge in practice. By the looks of them all, Hermione was the most impatient, and every now and then she looked at Ilya coldly, apparently craving revenge for yesterday's defeat.   - Mr. Ilya," the boy turned around and noticed the esteemed Professor Flitwick standing next to him. A man of small stature, but great intelligence and heart.    - Yes, Professor," Ilya replied politely.   - Mr. Ilya, I expect something impressive from you today," the professor smiled slightly. - Oh, you should not make such eyebrows, - maybe he is also a Jew? It's an Odessa turn of phrase. - I used to keep my old robes in classroom number 22. They had piled up too much.   Ilya paused for a moment, and then realized that this was the office where he practiced his magical arts three nights a week, and sometimes more often.    - Uh, yes, Professor.   Flitwick nodded and headed over to the students to open the classroom and begin the lesson - the bell was about to ring.   - Professor," Ilya called out to the sometimes comical halfling, he turned around and raised his right eyebrow questioningly. - Thank you, Professor.   Ilya put that "thank you" basically as a thank you for not being obstructed or ratted out to anyone. Flitwick seemed to understand him correctly. - You're welcome, Mr Ilya. Not at all.   The Charm Cabinet was like an amphitheater, but Ilya, not betraying himself, staggered to the gallery, where he sat next to a window. In general, the windows, beautiful half-windows, as if they were showcases, were clearly mantled to be unbreakable. Explosions were quite frequent in the study, something was burning, melting and boiling, and any careless student could cause the death of another - an unlucky student sitting near the window. So, having made sure that it was absolutely safe here, Ilya sat down in the farthest corner, from which he had a perfect view of the blackboard, the professor and a stunning view.    - Let's begin," the teacher began his lecture when the bell rang. - In the last lesson we have finally finished the theoretical base, and now we begin practical application of our knowledge. So, first of all, let's refresh our memory of the basics. Who can tell me the components of any spell? Please, Miss Granger.   - From a wave of the wand and a certain formula.   - That's right," Ilya sighed heavily; that was only true of the juniors. The older ones, on the other hand, had their spells all wrapped up- Runes and nonverbal components and whatnot. Merlin couldn't tell. - Ten points for Gryffindor. So, the very first spell, traditionally learned - the spell of levitation. I assure you, despite their simplicity and lack of appearance, they are quite useful and will help you many times in your life's journey. Well, let me show you. The first thing to do is to make a slight, smooth movement as if you were trying to outline an egg, and then confidently utter it:   - Wingardium Leviossa.   Sighs of delight ran through the room as the textbook lying in front of the teacher soared and swirled under the ceiling.    - Well, let's all do this spell together. No wands yet!   - Wingardium Leviossa," the students said together.   - Excellent! Well, you can all see the feathers in front of you. The goal at most is to learn how to lift them in the air by the end of the lesson. But don't worry, if you can't do it right away. I'm sure you all will master the charms after just some practice. Now, let's do it!   After that, it was everyone's duty to shout the right formula as loudly as possible. Especially the greatest mind in the universe, Ronald Wisdom, was tearing up. Only a few people concentrated on pronouncing and waving their wands correctly. It would be another two years before these geniuses from magic learned that in magic, often the only thing that mattered was desire. Yes, yes, sometimes there was no need for wands or artifacts or formulas and certainly not wands, but a simple, sincere desire to do something impossible and unbelievable. However, that wasn't something Ilya knew about yet, either. He tensed, spreading the heat over his body and biting his lip until it bled. Heavy hailstones of sweat rolled down his forehead and he found it hard to breathe. Ilya tried to mentally "encompass" the entire study, and "find" in it all the necessary objects for charms. Such magic was too much for him, but he was determined to impress Professor Flitwick.    - Wingardium Leviossa," said the boy.   And as if a whole, loaded with stones, the sack slumped down on his shoulders. Ilya felt an incredible weight pressing him to the ground. But still he endured, endured, and held on.   - I did it! - there was one shout.   - Me too! - sounded the second one.   - I made it, too! - The third one echoed them.   All the feathers in the study were floating in the ceiling, including Professor Flitwick's quill. The children stared at their wands in a daze, and no one seemed to know what the real reason for the bacchanal was.   - Professor," Zabini suddenly perked up, shaking her raven-winged hair. - Why can't we control their flight?   Flitwick smiled mischievously.   - Mr. Ilya, will you answer that?    Ilya shook his head in denial, a trickle of blood running down his chin from his bitten lip, and he knew that if he opened his mouth, the feathers would fall. He couldn't take another conversation.   - Oh, I see, I see," the enchantment master murmured, but he didn't ask me to release the magic. - Well, I have to disappoint you, but it's Mr. Ilya's magic that's keeping the feathers in the air now, not yours.    A wave of whispers ran through the room, and everyone turned at once to the pale boy. Now, more than ever, his blue, slightly darker whites and black, resinous hair were clearly visible. And a trickle of blood, of course. When all eyes focused on him, Ilya couldn't hold back his eccentricity, he mustered his strength, waved his wand, and feathers came together in a pile. He waved some more and they twirled in pairs, as if in a waltz. It didn't last long, just a few seconds. And then all the feathers fell to the ground, and Ilya exhaled with a resounding exhale; that was the limit beyond which he could pass out.   - Splendid! - Flitwick applauded, but he was the only one generous enough to applaud. - Mr. Ilya, may I ask how much time you've spent practicing these enchantments and all that goes with them?   - A hundred and twenty, maybe a hundred and fifty hours," Ilya shrugged, not at all deceiving.   Now the nation was dumbfounded, it seemed only now that many apprentices had realized that being a good mage meant labor-labor and more labor-labor.   - Wonderful, simply amazing," the professor nodded his head. - But, young man, I won't give you any points.    Of course he wouldn't, the professor couldn't afford to encourage disruption. Not to notice, yes, but not to encourage.    - I didn't pretend to," Ilya felt himself getting dizzy, and it was getting harder to get air through his lungs.    - Mr. Ilya, will you walk yourself to the hospital wing?   - Undeniably.   - Then I'll ask you not to stay too long, it might get worse.   Ilya was about to mutter something like "I know," but he stopped himself in time. He made awkward, clumsy movements, threw on the bag he'd never opened, and then headed for the exit with not the firmest of steps. He caught Hermione's blank stare as he dashed out the door, not knowing what to think. However, Ilya didn't have the energy to contemplate the subject. He left the classroom, closing the door tightly behind him, and hurried off as briskly as possible as the school healer.    Ilya opened the doors of the medical station, flying up to the third floor, holding on to the last drops of man-fuel. The smell of mixed herbs, some kind of potions and lotions hit my nose at once. Sterile whiteness stabbed his eyes, and dead silence filled his ears. Dead isn't the best metaphor for this place, but it is what it is. In just a moment a full-figured, gray-haired lady flew up to the boy. She seemed to represent the apogee of the stereotypical witch doctor. She was, as I said, fat and bonneted. She wore a pince-nez in a strange robe over a sundress, with puffy fingers and a good-natured smile that fell away when someone was "suffering.   - Oh, Mr. Ilya," Ilya was surprised that the woman knew his name. He had never been in this part of the castle before. - Sit down quickly.   Without asking where, the boy sat down on the nearest bunk, he was eager to stretch out and cram for another hour, but he did not want to show weakness. He didn't want to show weakness, especially not to himself. But the healer had already fluttered about, flying from one cupboard of potions to another like a bee from one flower to another. When she returned, she chided herself for being inattentive. An intricate sweep, an Episcei spell, and already her lip didn't hurt and it wasn't bleeding.   - Here, have a drink," Madame Pofmfri held out a bottle of amber liquid. Ilya's bandit nature suspected it to be cognac.    Without asking, Ilya tipped the potion into himself, marveling at the quite tolerable taste.   - What is it? - he asked, feeling the fatigue go away.   - Diluted Awakening Potion.    - Thank you.   - I'm not thankful for medicine," the healer frowned, but she relaxed instantly. - I'm sorry," she said, and then I was able to get out of the way.   And Ilya found nothing better than to nod and leave the medical wing and go to the dungeons, in order to change the most shabby mantle, and not so shabby - the ceremonial.         * * *          After a full meal, Ilya was already reclining on the bench, with his back against the cold castle wall. The feast was a success. The soaring pumpkins, whose grinning eyes glowed with purple flames, burst into hysterical laughter. Flying candles, with their skullless, jawless flames, were frightening. Bats, now and then dived at you in an attempt to bite, however they never reached. Cobwebs were spun at the corners of your robes, but within five minutes they were gone. And the occasional conjured draught, forced a tighter wrap in a thin robe. And there was no need to mention the table at all. Everything was decorated in style Halloween, and the taste was delicious. If it weren't for the daily jogging and training, Ilya would have feared that by sixteen he'd get fat and resemble Neville.    The doors to the hall flew open abruptly, and Professor Quirrell burst in, clad in his ceremonial robe and the same purple turban.   - T-troll! - he wailed. - A T-troll has escaped from the dungeons!   With these words the teacher's eyes rolled back and he collapsed. There was a shriek, and Ilya smirked, saying that this was a holiday prank and that they should be more daring. But the squealing and screaming didn't stop, with Malfoy in particular screaming at the Green table. He was squealing like a girl...   - Quiet!" The headmaster's voice boomed over the hall, sounding unusually harsh. - I'll ask everyone to calm down, headmasters, take the students to the living rooms. The teachers come with me.   Now Ilya felt uncomfortable, too. The students, in orderly lines, hurried to leave the Great Hall, and the teachers left through the hidden door next to their desk. If this was a joke, it had gone on long enough, and if it wasn't... where can we find this fucking troll? I mean, I'd really like to get a glimpse of the mythical creature. As the Slytherins were about to be separated from the general flow, Herb spotted an easily recognizable puny boy, with disheveled black hair, and a redheaded longhair. The pair had now snuck around the first corner and seemed intent on making their way up to the second floor. Ilya wouldn't be himself if he didn't rush after them. They might know something; maybe these assholes wanted to see the troll too, and they didn't call him in - the boorish ones.    Through a not-so-secret passage, Ilya went up to the second floor and almost puked when a not-so-sensitive nose was reached by a not-so-perfect ambergrance. Ilya heard some rumbling, then a quiet negotiation from around the corner and the stomping of feet, ending with the slam of a door. Something was looming, but the guy just couldn't help himself. That nasty smell seemed to cloud his consciousness and Ilya just couldn't move, trying not to part with such a delicious dinner. Finally he let go and immediately stepped out into the corridor. The sounds of either a fight or an orgy were coming from the abandoned restroom where the Crybaby-Mirtle dwelt. Without long thinking, Ilya flew into it, kicking the door open.   What was his surprise when, in the ruined bathroom, among the battered sinks fountaining water, among the wreckage of the green stalls and across the broken tiles, surrounded by a dazed, weeping Hermione, a dazed Ron, stood this three-foot tall troll. He was fat, clumsy, with almost stone skin, covered in innumerable warts. He held a wooden club in his hand and tried to reach the back of his head with it. But most interesting - the monster was saddled with Harry Potter, who zealously tried to pierce the brain of the creature with his wand, choosing the method of "through the nostril. Once again Ilya was amazed at the strength of the bespectacled man's balls of steel. He would never have dared to do it himself. At one point, Potter slipped off the trawl's neck and rolled down it like a water slide, well the clumsy asshole, who smelled like a real asshole, hit himself on the head with his club. And as a consequence, he decided to rest on the cold floor. Apparently in shock at what was going on.   - Fucking...   - What's going on here? - It came from behind me, and Ilya moved sharply aside.   On the threshold of the trashed toilet stood the "flower of the nation." The shuffling Professor Quirrell, the disheveled Iron Lady, the main greasy-haired bastard, the deeply respected Professor Flitwick, and the kindest grandfather in the land. The only thing missing was Sprout and her flowers, which are sometimes more lethal than a death spell, so pun intended.   - Professor McGonagall," a flustered Hermione took the floor. - "It's my fault. I heard about the troll and thought I could overpower it. Came running in here and couldn't do anything. And the boys, Gary and Ron, saved me, they overpowered the troll, and a minute later you were here.   - You are lying! - Snape shouted, but then, meeting Dumbledore's condemning gaze, he pulled himself back. - What a ridiculous thing, first-years defeating a grown-up mountain troll.    And he shouted it with such confidence, as if he had seen for himself what had happened here. But that wasn't possible. Ilya tensed, he didn't like the looks between the dean of snakes and the headmaster, he didn't like something about what was going on, as if there was some magchy secret hidden here. Too serious to ignore.    - Is that what happened? - McGee turned to the guys.   They looked at each other and nodded uncertainly.   - Well, then, minus fifteen points with Miss Granger for blatant recklessness. I had a better opinion of you, miss," the Dean of Lions shook her head, but immediately sparkled her eyes in excitement. - And thirty points to Gryffindor for... amazing luck.    Snape and McGonagall are the same kind of people, too much for their own faculties.   - That's all very well," said Flitwick. - But what is Mr. Ilya doing here?   At once they all turned to Ilya, whom they had seemingly never noticed before. Ilya looked perplexed at the spell master who had surrendered him, but the halfling only shook his head vigorously, indicating that he did not approve of such behavior. Now Ilya was faced with the question of what to say. But then it suddenly dawned on him that he could verify everything...   - I was just passing by.   - Walking by? - Snape hissed.   - Yeah. Don't know anything, haven't touched anyone, haven't been, haven't been involved, haven't been involved.    - You're clowning around, Ilya," the potionist chewed as if he were chewing paper, then shrieked sharply. - Look me in the eyes!   - Severus!" shouted Dumbledore disapprovingly, but it was too late.    The boy shuddered and involuntarily obeyed the order. And at the same moment the recent events and, importantly, the thoughts and feelings that he was experiencing at that time flashed before his eyes.   - So you were passing by, huh? - the professor hissed again. - I thought we understood each other, I guess I was wrong.    With these words the potionist left the bathroom, and Ilya realized that first of all he had lost his patronage and therefore he was in for a fun day. And also - that there was something he did not know about fucking telepaths. But he had to find out. Chapter 4      November 12, 1991 Hogwarts, the underbelly.      Throwing the toad's eyes into the cauldron and stirring clockwise three times, Ilya added seven degrees to the flame and turned away, holding back his gagging urges. Nearby stood Daphne, looking at her classmate like a week-old horse's excrement. In fact, at the moment Ilya looked no better than that same excrement. The boy reasonably assumed that this potions study would finish him off someday. No, the orphan considered himself a seasoned, sighted Scary Square native, where there were more abominations than a blown ego in Slytherin's living room. He'd seen brains spilling out on the pavement, and dismemberment, and how one of the whores had been let in circles by nine thugs at once (bad timing for a lad who decided to deliver a letter while working as a messenger) and how the particularly badass seniors from the orphanage had slaughtered a live cat, and how ... Ilya had seen many abominations. But potions turned out to be the apogee of the magic world craziness. For example, now in the cauldron stirred: a paw of a heron, eyes of a toad, some poisonous moss, skin of a boomslang and shit of a varan. Shit. Mother. Him. The varan. No wonder Snape's so fucked up in the head. Merlin, after his lessons in that stuffy dungeon, reeking of the most disgusting smells, Ilya felt like a hundred-year-old man who could fold up like a house of cards in a strong gust of wind. But the amazing thing was that no one in the castle, without an understatement, was in solidarity with Ilya. Yes, some disliked the subject because of the instructor, some disliked all those long, complicated recipes, but not a single person in the castle felt such fierce, genuine disgust. All the students were quite neutral about the potions themselves, and the most fond of them even loved them. The most terrible thing was that in order to work properly, as Ilya had recently found out, he needed to have a COV and a FAT for these very Potions, so the boy would be in for a long time.   - What, no good? - I'm sorry," Greengrass asked in a voice as venomous as the juice of a wolf berry. - Maybe you should go cry to your mommy. Oh, how could I forget, you don't have a mommy. And no daddy. They're probably dead by now. Hey, do you ever think that your daddy was some kind of stoned garbage man and your mommy was some kind of penny slut? What am I talking about, of course you did, you're the smart one. Little Ilya, how do you live with that? Do you have suicidal thoughts? Or don't you have the guts? Just tell us, we'll help you.   Ilya clenched his teeth and clenched his fists. Sometimes he wished he could hit girls, because sometimes he wanted to. He was a bit disappointed that they were not allowed to curse them, but Ilya was just as bad at cursing as he was at Transfiguration, but the rest of the Slytherins were...   - You know, Miss Grass," Daphne turned pale, infuriated by the way her last name was deranged. Not the least of the aristocratic, by the way. - I think I'll take you to my neighbourhood one day. But really, don't be offended when I take your wand and leave it there. You know, you got to help the hungry. And people out there are so hungry for satin skin and a mouth full of teeth. You wouldn't mind satisfying, say, a couple dozen smelly bums at a time, would you? However, if you're afraid, you can ask your mamchoka, I think she'll tell you how to do it. After all, it's customary for your PS brother to share everything. We're family after all. Look, are you sure you're your daddy's daughter and not some good-for-nothing with a tag?   Ilya had never liked to stoop to insulting his family, but lately he was finding it increasingly difficult to hold back. Snape had stripped him of his bastard patronage, and now every Slytherin felt it was their duty to hurt the only Muggleborn in the department. Greengrass especially tried and succeeded in this, after all she spent more time with him than any of the Greens. As many as three classes a week, Illya had to stand behind the same cauldron with her, and keep herself from drowning this purebred slut in the foul-smelling cauldron.   Daphne's face turned pale when she heard the tirade, and she clenched her little fists. The girl was a head shorter than Ilya, but she was not afraid of him.    - Greengrasses never took any tags," she hissed like a little snake.   - I don't care," Ilya shrugged, reading in his textbook how many degrees should be turned down on the burner when the potion would take a delicate violet hue. The main thing was not to vomit into the potion, but the author of the recipe, for some reason, had not mentioned such little things.   - Filthy filthy girl," the noblewoman continued to sputter. - You don't know anything about our society.   - You're absolutely right," Ilya nodded with a clever look on his face. - I'm not used to digging through shit and rottenness.   It seemed as if Greengrass was ready to curse her classmate. Probably not, though. All the Slytherins, as one, were excelling in ZoTI. The snakes' defense was going along with the badgers, and Illya was having a hard time keeping up his reputation as the best. When he had studied curses in the Hollow Cauldron, he had thought he had a handle on the subject, but harsh reality had shattered the rosy locks of vain illusions. The mere sight of Malfoy conjuring up Peregrine Feet at breakneck speed made Ilya blanch and grit his teeth. Theodore Nott's left and right thrusting of the Petrificus was enough to leave one dizzy with sweat to see what was happening. No, of course, Illya was no idiot, and could do all sorts of things. But not with such speed, precision and accuracy. The boy reasoned to himself that the purebloods must have been taught at home by their kindly ancestors.    The most miserable thing was something else. Ilya stuck too tightly to his "code," which said, in black and white, "don't knock. He didn't knock. But when poor Neville was jumping up and down with glued legs after another Malfoy stunt, or when Dean Thomas was covered in pustules from Zabini's gift, Ilya almost forced himself to keep from snapping to the vultures and telling them that it was time to get a load of knowledge, because the slugs were way ahead on this issue. But the code kept him in place, and the scarlet men were unaware, for they were studying together with the crows.   - I'm already waiting for that beautiful moment," Daphne threw another alchemical concoction into the potion and stirred it clockwise. - When you'll run to Dumbledore in tears and crawl on your knees, begging him to transfer you to another department. And when it turns out that's impossible, you'll hang yourself in the toilet.    - Naive," Ilya grinned, turning down the burner and keeping his nose as far away from the fumes as possible. He was already feeling a little queasy. - You think you scared me? Or that you snotty snotty snotty snotty snotty snotty snotty snot can do anything to me? Or maybe you think you're scarier than a psychopathic maniac who dissects his victim with scissors and then eats his insides in front of him. I used to live across the street from a dickhead like that.   - Still holding on to your muggles, are you? You have no idea how much pain magic can cause, but hopefully you'll find out soon enough.   - Magic schmagic. Suck it up and find out what it's like to try to keep your guts falling out of your belly.   - Fool," Daphne shook her head, which made her beautiful, white hair ripple like a milky waterfall. - You're the one who's going to get kicked out of school with a broken wand. We'd only get a wink of the finger.    - Ah, yes," Ilya nodded sadly. - Oh, how I forgot that you always hide behind your rich daddies' and mothers' asses at once. I've missed it, sir.   - I don't see what's wrong with that - using what we have. But you don't. You have nothing.   - Wrong," glinted the former bastard, thug and outlaw, with sharp, predatory eyes. - I've got something your lot don't. Balls and brains. I assure you, it's enough to make you kneel before Professor Dumbledore and choke on blood, not tears.   - Yeah, and that's why you're hiding behind the skirts of seventh-year girls," Daphne snarled sarcastically.   - Who said anything about taking advantage of me? - Ilya bluffed, realizing that he had nothing to hide in this matter.   And the point was this. Snape had really taken away his patronage, and it had become really dangerous to be in the living room. An accidental curse, a harmful spell, or some other nasty thing. All of these things were attracted to Ilya. So he began to spend as much time as possible outside the dungeons. He would get there well after midnight to sleep and then get out before dawn. His routine was now very uncomfortable. After school, he sat idly in the library, helping those who asked, reading fiction and science literature. In the evening the girls dragged him away, as always, to fondle him, play with him, and amuse their developing maternal instinct. Ilya did not resist, so this saved him from the society of his compatriots, provided him with the latest news, well, and still pleasantly amused his ego. After lights out, Ilya headed to class "22", where up to midnight he studied magic arts, passing more and more new subjects. Mostly Charms of course, since things were going very, very tight in the other subjects. By one o'clock in the morning, sneaking like a cat or a thief, Ilya would go down into the dungeons. There he would slump onto the bed, with a knife in his hand, though he did not remove his trousers (his asylum habits returned). Just the third night after the troll incident, Malfoy and co. woke up in the middle of the night and wanted to give him a dark one. In the morning, four guys showed up at the hospital wing with varying degrees of broken faces. Ilya didn't go there, and for a couple of days he proudly flashed his black eye - the big guy Goyle had reached, though, and was telling anyone who wanted to know how, where, and who had won. Still, it was only the beginning. Just the other day, on his way back from his morning run on the edge of the forest, the boy came across a whole delegation. There was Marcus Flint, the imposing captain of the Quidditch team, Malfoy and Co, Greengrass and Blaze, and a hodgepodge of second through seventh year students. There were about fifteen of them. And Ilya had already prepared for battle. In his left hand gleamed a knife blade, in the right wand. But at the same second, when it was almost started unequal battle, out of the next room, tired, but happy seven students from other departments. Apparently they were having a booze party, on the occasion of someone's birthday. And what was their surprise when the Hogwarts favorite, was taken in a ring by the Slytherin trash. Understandably, there was an urgent need to do good and inflict justice. The mass battle turned into yet another visit to the hospital for some, and a workout for others. Ilya himself had time to cut a good sixth-year snake with a knife, and then Professor McGonagall, along with Snape, three hours brainstormed all involved, on the application of semi-dark magic spell "Seco". However, this same Snape, quite insistently tried to catch sight of Illya, but the latter, taught by bitter experience, diligently hid it. Since then, for several days now, gentlemen seniors, took "under the wing" of Ilya. Tom, frankly, did not like it, it literally pissed him off. He is not some snot-nosed boy, to be coddled, but people were adamant. And as Ilya had found out, adult witches should not be pissed off, they should be avoided a mile away.   He was also not in the mood for Hermione's changed behavior. She rarely sat down with Ilya in the library anymore, spending all her time with Potter and Weasley (it had taken a lot of trouble for the bassot to learn that last name). And the lions themselves, after the same incident with the troll began to treat her warmer. In principle, Ilya was happy for the girl, but a prick of sadness still touched his heart. Now he was clearly aware of his loneliness. Yes, another paradox, surrounded by people who always smiled at him and were always happy for him, he felt lonely. After all, in spite of everyone's "love", he never had any friends. For the Slytherins he was a "Dirty Girl", and he wasn't attracted to those stuck-up assholes, while for the others he was a "smart, handsome, nice-looking and his boyfriend", but he was still a Slytherin. But anyway, the hat warned him that if he wanted power, he'd have to sweat it out in the snake department, which would be really hard, and the guy was willing to endure and not complain. It was just that at times, he was overcome by severe bouts of sentimentality and melancholy, especially during those hours when he was writing letters to friends.   - I don't remember giving you permission to talk," the greasy-haired lecturer hissed, floating like a black ghost.   - It's okay, Professor," Ilya smiled. - Daphne's just professing her love for me, and I'm trying to convince her that Goyle would be better for her.    - It's not like that! - She shrieked at Greengrass, causing laughter among the Gryffindors.   - Watch the potion," the professor cut off, and disappeared among the scarlet tables.    - I'll finish you off," Daphne whispered.   - You'll break your teeth," Ilya grinned.   By this time the potion had already taken on a purple hue. The magic ingredients were completely dissolved in it, but Ilya would never drink this "general anesthetic". He'd rather drink aspirin or take a short sip of coffee. Parallel to Greengrass and Ilya, Malfoy and Crabbe finished their work, Hermione and Parvati, well, that was it. The others just stared sullenly into their cauldrons, where substances of all colors and smells were simmering.    - Professor, sir," Malfoy raised a thin hand.   - Yes, Mr. Malfoy," the greasy-haired man said calmly.   - Professor, I have a headache, can I go to the hospital wing?   Snape stepped closer to the table, peered into the students' cauldron and nodded approvingly.   - Go," he said and turned around to give Potter and the redhead a little shake.   Malfoy, elated by his success and not at all like a man with a headache, got up and headed for the exit. As he passed Ilya, he gave him a strange look, as if promising something, smirked his snaky grin, and went out into the corridor. Ilya got a bad, lingering feeling, though, since there was nothing he could do, he hoped that he would discover in time and avoid some malicious trap or something like that.   The bell rang, and with a wave of his wand Professor Snape vaporized all the brews in the classroom. It was easier to breathe at once, and the mood brightened as well. Ilya closed his ink jar, which was wrapped in magic adhesive tape, since there were cracks in the ink jar, and he had no money for a new one. Illya had fifteen galleons, of which he'd only spent a few shekels - saving up. He did not know what he was saving up for, he was just saving up for the time being.    As always, the tall-haired man was especially generous with his homework. He literally piled up the necessary volume of the essay, something about three feet long. And Ilya knew that just the day before homework, in the Slytherin living room a parchment scroll with a perfect essay mysteriously appeared which had been forgotten by "someone". No, people did not cheat, but quite carefully read and rewrote it in their own words. Ilya himself never resorted to this method. To write an essay? What could be easier, here more time is spent on mechanical work than on understanding of the work. So, in an evening or two, the assignments were always ready.    Daphne, who had showered her classmate with a ton of disdain, rushed off to do her own girl thing, followed by Blaze. Next class was Charms, with the vultures again. Ilya threw his bag on his shoulder and staggered dejectedly to the second floor. Apathy always came over him after potions and for a while the boy couldn't shake the feeling of disgust reigning in the room with the cauldrons. Waiting for him at the exit was Lavender with Parvati and Isabelle MacDougal, the half-breed daughter of a witch and a banker. Isabelle was a short, swarthy girl with gray eyes. She had been tailing Brown and Patil, and for some reason she hated Hermione, though it wasn't that obvious, but Ilya had noticed it.   - Another scuffle? - I'm sorry," she asked Lavender sympathetically as the group walked toward the stairs.   To be frank, the company of those annoying girls was getting on his nerves, but he had to keep up the mark. Here were the obvious disadvantages of this image, which Ilya tried on himself.   - Pfft," Ilya brushed him off. - It's nothing serious.    - We're worried about you," Isabelle said.   - You don't have to.   - I am worth it," smiled the Indian girl, Parvati. - If the slugs kill you, who's going to help us with our homework?   - Ask Hermione.   The staircases, those wooden nasties, apparently sensing that Ilya was not walking up them alone, behaved quite decently. The portraits, hanging everywhere in the castle, gave the apprentices wistful looks. Ilya thought that painting with magic was a perverse method of torture. Condemning a man to an eternal half-life, what kind of sadist would that be? But, as they say, one does not pry into other people's monasteries.   - That nerd? - Isabelle wrinkled her nose. - Who needs her?   - Oh, is that so? And I thought she was welcome on the faculty.   - Rady, of course, is now running around with Potter, as is Weasley. And a friend of the Hero of Wizarding Britain is automatically a friend of the entire faculty.   Ilya laughed, it was quite amusing.   - Why are you laughing? -Lavender pouted.   - It's just too much like the Slytherins.   The girls looked at each other and smiled.   - Maybe," they said, almost in unison.   - Listen, are you coming over tonight? - With a little dullness in her eyes, McDougal asked.   - I don't know," Ilya shook his head. - I've already been called by the crows, and I kind of promised them.   - Of course," Brown muttered. - You're in short supply, aren't you?   - The inflated ones, by the way, carry water.   - He never sulks," Parvati quipped.    - That's right," Ilya nodded. - You've got five guys on the course after all.   The girls looked at the handsome Slytherin walking with his hands behind his head with obvious skepticism.   - They don't talk to us," Isabelle sighed. - She was so surprised to see us, and if we wanted to talk to them, they'd start mooing and then go off to play their spitballs or talk about Quidditch.   - Yes," cried Ilya. - Trouble is, they're probably not interested in playing dolls with you - We don't play dolls!   Ilya laughed again, and Isabelle tried to reach for him with her fist, but she failed. The boys went up to the second floor, where the usual crowd had already gathered. Flitwick was never late, but he never showed up early either. Apparently, religion didn't allow it. Dim glints of sunlight streamed down the walls, wrapped in a thick cloudy blanket. Winter was coming, promising cold and dank Scottish winds. Ilya had never liked winter, no he wasn't sick or perpetually drowsy like some, he just didn't.   - Come on," the boy smiled. - I'm going to grow up and chase you around.   - And you're a grown-up, huh?   - Nah, I'm a foster kid. We're all like that.   - Like what? - Isabelle's eyes darted around.   - Beautiful and clever," winked Ilya.   - More like insolent and unabashed," Lavender snorted to general laughter.   The boys stopped next to the rest of the students. The Slytherins, seeing their fellow Slytherin in the camp of the enemy, grimaced as usual and pretended that the freak did not belong to their family. It was only a couple of minutes before class started and Ilya assumed his usual pose, which told everyone that he was out of range. The boy covered his eyes and leaned against the wall. The eternally cold ancient stonework was pleasantly cooling after such a "hot" lesson as Potions. Ilya didn't know how he would endure just under seven years of this hell, but he hoped that in time he would get used to it and it would be easier for him to deal with bouts of vomiting and disgust. Now, the Charas, that was another matter, a true salvation. A huge bright classroom with a full-wall window, an interesting subject, a great teacher, what else do you need to be in a good mood?   - Hey, Ilya," came a haughty, brittle voice.   Ilya sighed and opened his eyes. Right in front of him stood Draco, holding some sort of bundle of cloth, dark cloth.   - What do you want Malfoy? - the boy asked tiredly.   - You know, Ilya, I was in our bedroom, and I accidentally tripped over some rubbish in the corner," said the platinum blond, pulling at the edge of the cloth, and black and brown chips of various sizes fell to the stone floor with a deafening crack. There was a muffled "Bom," which made a bang, and a bruised mustached stick. - It looked to me like it was yours, and I wrapped it in a nearby rag. Oh, wait, it's your robe, though. Merlin, this is embarrassing.   Ilya felt as if something had been pulled out of him with a whistling and cracking sound. It was as if something important had evaporated at the same moment when he saw the broken guitar fingerboard, how the base (a.k.a., for those who didn't know, it was called a body) wobbled like a yoke, how the top dock, painted with autographs of his friends and Vicky, the guitarist of a popular magic rock band "The Witch Sisters", cried with splinters. The way the pegs rolled around like orphaned kittens, dangling from the moaning strings. It was all so horrible, so impossible, that Ilya didn't notice Malfoy smirking, swinging a tattered, dirty rag in his hands that really was Ilya's robe, which he'd carelessly left on the bed.    Ilya could only feel the music itself being whistled out of him, the last thing that connected the boy to his family, the last thing that was dear to him. And then the boy felt something else entirely. He felt the heat rising in his chest, the difficulty of continuing to stand still, felt the world narrowing to a single point - Malfoy's Brawl. A terrible rage rose in the normally calm boy's heart. It was as if, once again, Ilya found himself in Skary Square, surrounded by three bassots ready to unleash their guts on both him and his friends.    No one noticed what happened, only a smudged shadow flashed before the dazed boys. A silver thread flashed, and Malfoy jerked back, clasping his hands to his body. From his left shoulder, down to his right thigh, he had a wide streak of scarlet. Malfoy turned sharply pale and stared with genuine fear at Ilya, whose face was twisted with terrible rage. The handsome boy now looked like a ravenous cat, ready to leap. His long, white fangs were visible, and his blue eyes glowed with bright fire.   - Ilya shook his head as he tried to correct his mistake by stabbing the stupid faggot between the ribs, but some force knocked him aside, knocking him painfully against the wall.    - What's going on here? - Shouted Professor Snape, holding Illya in his sights. Malfoy was already on his knees, mindlessly watching as scarlet drops of blood fell to the stone floor. Red, not blue, but plain red, human blood. Even the aristocrats inside, just ordinary people.    - Professor, Illya attacked Draco! - Theodore Nott shouted.    The dean of green froze for a moment, then looked at his godson with genuine concern.   - Draco," he exhaled.   The short-haired man crossed the space between them in a single step. He waved his wand over the blond's body, but nothing happened, the blood didn't stop, and the wound didn't heal. Dean was dumbfounded, but when he pulled himself together and saw that it was, in fact, just a deep scratch, he conjured up a bandage to block the cut and called for Crabbe and Goyle.   - Take Mr. Malfoy to the Hospital Wing," Snape squeaked.   The boogeymen nodded and carried their leader, who was now posing as a wounded hero. He ducked his head and did not even try to drag his feet, hanging entirely on the mighty shoulders of his minions.    - What the bloody hell do you think you're doing, Ilya?! - snarled Snape, whose face was just as twisted with anger.   - Professor Snape," Potter, whose disheveled hair looked ridiculously like a pineapple leaf, suddenly interjected. - It's Malfoy's fault. He broke Ilya's guitar on purpose and ruined his robe.   - Don't believe Potter, sir! - Daphne jumped up, supported by her friend. - Draco accidentally did it and wanted to apologize, and Ilya, he's crazy and just went off the rails.   The situation was becoming a real bacchanalia, with the Gryffindors and Slytherins shouting at each other, defending their points of view. The situation was getting dangerously heated. He couldn't lift a finger, let alone open a mouth, because he was more tightly bound to the wall than a tether holds a pack-dog. And yet, Ilya could feel the heat building up in his heart. Warm, militant sweat ran down his back, and his arm and leg muscles involuntarily contracted. This had never happened before.   - Silence! - Snape hissed in his trademark tone and everyone was instantly silent.   The potter waved his wand, and Ilya peeled himself off the wall. However, the boy didn't lash out at the greasy-haired bastard, who clearly condoned his godson. At his wave, Malfoy was allowed to leave the class. And didn't the fucking telepath understand what was going on? Of course he did, and decided to back up the serpent and that's why he was in that corridor so just in time. And yet, the boy, instead of snapping into action, was fully immersed in this new sensation for him. He had never felt this heat so strongly before. It seemed like he should be in pain, he should be howling like his blood was boiling, he should be moaning like his skin was burning and his bones were melting. But no, he .didn't feel it, but he didn't feel the pleasure of the heat either, he just knew it had to be that way. This flame inside him, it was native and... right.    - Ilya, what spell did you use, you obnoxious boy?!   - It wasn't a spell," Greengrass interjected again. - He stabbed Draco.   - A knife? - Snape was surprised. - Give me that knife Ilya.   - No.   - Immediately, Ilya! If you don't want more trouble!   - No.   - Ilya," Snape was ready to tear the insolent boy apart. - Either you give me the knife, or I'll give you a month's pay.   - All right.   - What's good?   - A month's work," Ilya shrugged, holding back that inner fire. - It's not hard for me.   For a while, Snape glared at Illya, who looked away diligently. Then the black flash of the professor's wand flashed.   - Accio knife!   And then time seemed to slow down. Ilya could clearly feel the tension growing in his hand clutching the butterfly. And in an instant a decision pierced the bassot's mind. With a whistle the wand flew up, cutting the air in a clear vertical line.   - Protego! - shouted the boy, and the knife twitched in his hand. The shield was weak, not even visible, whereas with others it usually appeared as a slightly transparent silver wall, as if made of papyrus leaf. But even that was enough for a kid inexperienced in ZOTI, to repel the household spells. But time still wasn't speeding up, and Ilya could feel the hatred turning to anger as the hot flames erupted supernova and lava fire flowed through his veins.   "They dared to take the music," thought Ilya, drunk with rage. - "And now they want to take Rosie away!"   And just as he thought of his family, of the gift the bastard wanted to take away, all the flames raging through him, dispelled by his hot heart, rushed to his right hand.   - Incendio! - Ilya shrieked, feeling the heat leave his body in his wand and surge outward.   A huge, roaring stream of flame burst from the boy's wand. It was literally a horizontal fire tornado half a meter in diameter, ready to devour everything in its path. And it was aimed solely at Snape. Most likely, he would have repelled it as easily as a pesky mosquito. But no one would ever know. The dwarf's figure flashed and the roaring bright orange flames vanished, showering red sparks. The bell rang, and a stunned Professor Flitwick stood next to Snape, holding his wand in his hands. He looked at Ilya, not with condemnation, but with obvious excitement and concern.   The boy was about to ask, "What?" as a weakness, a terrible weakness reached him. Ilya swayed, and stared directly at the gleaming armor. It reflected the pale face of his finger, with trickles of blood running down it. Scarlet snakes ran from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, pouring blood over his clothes. Ilya staggered once more and, hearing the distant echo, fell to the floor. There was no pain from the fall; there was nothing around, only dense, lingering gloom. Ilya lost consciousness.      November 12, Hogwarts, Hospital Wing.      In the hospital wing, despite the late evening and the total absence of patients, which was rare, no small number of professors crowded in. The Iron Lady, sitting in her chair, scrutinized the usual bowie knife. Snape, distancing himself from the others, simply waited for some sort of verdict. Flitwick, sitting on the edge of his patient's bed, shook his head sadly, as if bemoaning himself for something. Dumbledore, on the other hand, was nibbling on lemon wedges and stroking the phoenix which was nestled in his lap. Well, Madam Pomfrey, anxiously fixing the bangs of the beautiful boy, who was in a magical coma due to complete exhaustion, once again added a special solution to the drip.   - But it's a very ordinary knife," McGonagall muttered, placing the butterfly on the nightstand - next to the wand. Which, by the way, had been checked for the latest spells, finding that the boy had been training advanced transmutation and simple shield spells like the damned lately.    - I have no reason not to believe my students," Snape hissed. - If they said Ilya stabbed him, then that's exactly what happened.   - I didn't say that, Severus. Mine, too, insisted on the knife version. But you can't usually leave a wound with an iron that doesn't heal Episkei.    - So the boy is studying Dark Magic after all," the potter grumbled. - And I told you, Dumbledore, you can't let a boy study Slytherin. What did you have to do to convince Hat to send him to the Hufflepuffs?    - You can't take away people's freedom of choice," the headmaster shook his head.   - Freedom of choice," Snape spat, seemingly disgusted by the very fact of being among his colleagues. He seemed disgusted by the very fact of being among his colleagues. - Not exactly the shape of a Dark Lord, this bratty lad, but a regular Greyback-type fiend. He should be ruled out before this case takes too sharp a turn.   For the first time ever, Professor McGonagall didn't argue with the dean of the opposing department when it came to expelling any of the students.   - Don't jump to conclusions, Severus," Flitwick shook his head. - Magic has too many wonders to be ruled out for it.   - You consider the apprentice's dismembered body a miracle?!   - I'm sorry, Severus, I'm old and maybe even blind, but I didn't see any dismemberment. A little scratch, yes, but nothing more.    - He was going to kill him!   - The boy has a complex temperament and no childlike view of the world," Master Char remarked. - He won't settle for verbal altercations or fist fights.    - You indulge him too much," Minerva chided her old friend.   - Well, as the Muggles say, if not me, then who? - The halfling shrugged philosophically.   There was an oppressive silence in the hospital room for a while, interrupted only by the croak of a contented phoenix. Outside the window, a full moon peeked out from behind the black clouds, occasionally catching a glimpse of tall figures standing around the white bunk. Madam Pomfrey had no voice in this argument, but if she had, she would have done anything to ensure that this serene, poor boy with a bunch of scars on his body would be left alone and just let him live.    - Dumbledore, say something! - Snape couldn't help it.   Albus seemed to awaken from his slumber, and woke up. He stroked the cooing surname and old friend, and tucked the slices into a pocket of his robes.    - It wasn't dark magic," the headmaster said, dumbfounding everyone present. - And, frankly, I wouldn't want to lose someone as passionate about sweets as I am. But perhaps, in this matter, someone else should have a say. Fawkes, you old rascal, what do you think?   The phoenix froze, then sprang from its perch in the form of the old man's calves, and settled directly on the boy's chest. The mythical bird spread its wings, sheltering Ilya with them, and roared furiously at Minerva and Severus. As if to say she wouldn't let them take the child.   - Fawkes seems to like Mr. Illya," Dumbledore smiled and flashed his eyes familiarly.   - Mark my word, Dumbledore," Snape sighed, realizing that he had lost here. - Slytherin will break him.   - No, Severus," the enchantment master shook his head. - Slytherin would make him stronger.   - Harder?! - Madam Pomfrey couldn't stand it. - Look at him! He's just a child! What are you talking about?! It's our job to look after the children, not put them in danger!   - Perhaps, perhaps," said Flitwick, fixing his robe and preparing to leave the wing, when he stopped on the threshold and turned around. - I'm sure he's not the only one who looks more like us than he does like you.       December 7 Hogwarts, Hospital Wing.      Ilya woke up long, reluctantly, as if he were struggling through a dense gray haze. And when he opened his eyes, he immediately squeezed because of the bright midday sun, throwing its rays directly into his eyes. Once he got used to the bright, white light, the boy managed to open his eyelids. He was in the hospital wing. Ilya vaguely remembered the last events that had happened to him. Like Malfoy had broken his guitar, and Ilya had decided to teach the arrogant homo a lesson, and then he had sort of had a fight with Snape. Fought with Snape? Oh Merlin, brilliant, brilliant, couldn't be better. You'd have to be an idiot to attack a teacher.    - I see you've come to your senses," came a slightly quiet, muffled voice.   Ilya turned his head to the left and saw Professor Flitwick sitting on a low stool, enthusiastically reading a book about the Dark Elf, which happened to be in the boy's bag at the time of the incident.   - It's interesting what these people write," the charmer shook his head as he flipped to the last page. - What a flight of fancy.   - Sorry, Professor," Ilya mumbled. - I didn't see you there.   - That's not surprising. After total magical exhaustion, it's not the worst thing that can happen. I remember three years ago, a student thought he was a guinea pig for two weeks. And you just didn't notice me, and frankly, even healthy people don't always notice me.   Ilya smiled at the way the dwarf had deftly tricked him and himself at the same time.    - How long have I been lying here?    - Five days to a month.   Ilya whistled, exhaling, lying in a hospital bed for almost a month. Not a good way to start his studies. What a way to start - the first semester would be over soon!   - I can see you're concerned. I don't think you should be. You're so far ahead of schedule, you can afford another six months off.   - That's in theory, but in practice I'm woefully behind.   - Really? - Flitwick raised his eyebrows, then suddenly smiled wryly. And smiling smirkily at some part goblin is not a pleasant sight. - Tell me, Mr. Ilya, how did Mr. Ollivander describe your wand?   - As flexible as a spring creek and perfect for charms.    - What did he tell you about the wand and wizard connection?   - Well, it's up to the wand to choose who to go with in life.   - Ergo...   And then it hit the boy.   - Hence, my path is Charas.   - Great!   - Uh, thank you, Professor," the boy smiled. - I was beginning to think I was a magician like a bullet out of a... Well, not a very good magician. When I was studying ZoT and Transfiguration, I was always failing.   - It happens," the teacher nodded. - Young wizards are rarely able to master more than one branch of magic at once. But I wouldn't advise you to stop your classes, of course I'm inciting you to break the regime, but I think you'll break it anyway.    - So someday I'll be able to succeed in these sciences too?   - Not very likely," Flitwick shook his head. - But you won't know until you try...   - Yeah, I guess you're right, I'm still gonna keep taking the class.   Then the boy glanced over at the huge bag next to his bedside table, where his knife and wand were lying.    - Professor, what is it? - the boy wondered.   - Oh," said the dwarf, a little embarrassed. - You have quite a lot of well-wishers, and every one of them was obliged to bring some sweets. So, when they couldn't fit in this box or the next and threatened to go bad, I conjured up a sack. You know, spells of expanding space and spells of preserving temperature can be very useful sometimes.   Ilya smiled again. It was a pleasure.   - I see you're looking at your knife," Flitwick was smiling now. - Not the finest weapon you could find, but I think you value it enough to attack your professor for it.   - Uh, yeah, it was a gift from my sister.   - Sisters? I didn't know you had relatives.   - We're not related. We just lived together in the orphanage, there were actually four of us. And so it turned out that we considered ourselves to be one family.   - All four of them?   - All four of them," the boy nodded.   - Well, then I can understand you. But I still don't approve of your behavior. You could have hurt one of the students!   The boy allowed himself a smile and a little squint in his beautiful eyes.   - I thought you'd say I might have hurt Snape.   - Severus is a big boy now and would be able to defend himself against weak fire spells," Flitwick brushed aside.   The boy grew sad.   - It's the only battle magic I know," Ilya muttered a little bit grudgingly.   Filius stared at his apprentice with his eyes wide open for a while, and then laughed a slightly cackling laugh.   - When you sit for hours in the library, have you never borrowed a treatise on anything "actionable"? As the young people of today say.   - Of course I did," Ilya nodded his head. - But it's all kind of, um, I don't know how to explain it.   - Ineffective," said a grinning Flitwick, somehow pleased with himself.   - Yeah! That's right. The whole cotton foot, tickle, or bat-jinx, stunners thing is bullshit. My conscience wouldn't let me waste my time and energy on them.   - And as for what is now called Dark Magic? - The halfling squinted at him slyly. - You've read about that, too, haven't you?   - I read it," Ilya agreed. - But, then again, I don't know how to tell. But the spells of dissection, rotting flesh, whipping and torture, turning the victim inside out, and so on, it's all kind of...   - Not aesthetically pleasing. It's not aesthetically pleasing at all," the charmer came to the rescue once again.   - Yes! That's exactly what I was going to say.   - Then how are you going to fight, or rather, what are you going to fight with? And you're obviously going to fight with magic.   - Well," the boy was a little embarrassed. - Professor Dumbledore gave me a couple of books that explain how to make my own spells. So I figured, since I couldn't find anything interesting, I'd make it up myself. It sounds very arrogant and self-righteous, but I think I can do it.   - And how far you've come in inventing new spells.   - Uh, well, I haven't even started yet.   - So you're studying Numeralogy and the Runes?   - Yeah.   - Any luck?   - Um... Almost finished the first chapter.   - In two and a half months? - The professor chuckled.   - In two and a half months," the boy agreed sadly.   - Well, at least you're enthusiastic," Dean Ravenclaw laughed like a crow again. - Oh, and, Mr. Ilya, your guitar, it's... too badly damaged. I've tried every repair spell I know, but I'm afraid I've had no luck.   - Didn't you throw the rest away? - Ilya was worried about it.   - No, of course not.   - All right, then," the boy calmed down. - After all, what can't be fixed with magic can be fixed with hands.    Flitwick scrutinized the boy for some time, as if looking for some answers for himself. At that time the bell rang, announcing the end of the class.   - That's a very wise point. And now for the even more unpleasant part. Mr. Ilya, you were deducted fifty points for attacking your professor, which, at your rate, had no effect whatsoever on your Slytherin ranking. But what's worse, you've been given a month's detention.   - Fair enough," the boy nodded. - So I'll take up the guitar in a month.   - Oh," Flitwick said with a sudden, predatory smile. - You see, I figured a taller man wouldn't be able to keep up with a crafty little rascal like you. So I volunteered to do the workout with you. But I think you'd better take your last few minutes off and I've got a class to get to. Nice talking to you, Mr. Ilya.   And the old professor, jumping abruptly out of his chair, rushed towards the exit, not wishing to be late for his own subject. But as Filtwick was about to disappear out of the door, the boy called out to him.   - Thank you, Professor.   The boy couldn't help but say thank you, knowing that Flitwick must have gone to a lot of trouble to have the workouts done with him. He was dean of another department and shouldn't have cared so much for a Slytherin at all.   - You're welcome, Mr. Ilya," the charmer replied without turning around. - You're quite welcome.  Chapter 5   Chapter 5.          December 8, 1991 Hogwarts, second floor.      There was a polite knock on the door of the Transfiguration room, right in the middle of class. Professor McGonagall looked around her classroom, which was now puffing with excitement from Slytherin and her own faculty, and then raised her eyes to grief. It could only be one person.   - Come in, Mr. Ilya.   The door opened, and first a boy's head poked through, with beautiful blue eyes and, this time, slightly disheveled tarry hair.    - How did you know it was me?" the head asked.   - Elementary, Mr. Ilya.    Ilya almost fell over, either he was not fully recovered yet and should go back to the kind-hearted Pomfrey, or the Iron Lady was joking. Which of the two was worse and more bordering on complete "armageddon", Ilya was not sure.    - How much longer are you going to be hiding in there? - There was a distinct displeasure in old McGee's voice.   - Yeah, I mean, no, I mean, I'm sorry.   - Come on, Ilya, don't disturb the students.   Ilya nodded, cautiously entered, closed the door behind him, and went to his legally empty seat. And he turned out to miss his gallery, where he could take a nap and read a book and look at the girls. No, Ilya did not understand those who did not want to sit in the back.    - Where are you going, Ilya? - the professor asked, somewhat cheerfully.   Ilya froze, standing on one foot without finishing his step. Sensing something wrong, he turned around and saw a devilish grin on his teacher's face, promising him a tour through all the circles of hell.    - Back in your seat, ma'am.   - I have to disappoint you, Mr. Ilya, as of today, your seat will be at the first desk.   Cold sweat streamed down the barefoot's back. His worst nightmares were coming true, and he wished desperately that he could wake up, but this was reality nonetheless. Albeit a wild, crazy reality. Ilya looked around the front row, all the desks there were occupied by young wizards sitting in twos. They paid no attention to him, fully focused on the practical task. There was only one vacant row, or rather, conditionally vacant. The one where the greatest of the nerds, the incomparable Miss Granger, sat.   - Over there? - Ilya squeaked.   - Absolutely right.   - But why? - I thought the boy was about to switch to the mouse tongue, for his voice sounded so high pitifully.   - You're welcome, Mr. Ilya," the professor grimaced. - And why. You've missed a large number of classes, and Miss Granger has kindly agreed to help you. Show some respect.   Yeah, right. Ilya was sure that McGonagall had decided to increase her control over him, and that was why she'd arranged an act of transmigration. But that was okay, he would still fight his way back to his historic homeland. As Professor Beans would say, "a carefully nurtured desk." Not exactly true, of course, but... However, there was nothing to do, so Ilya moved directly under the eyes of the Iron Lady. Chair, where stood the table of the teacher and the first desk in the central row, where Granger sat, cut no more than three meters. Creepy.    Sitting down at the table, Ilya took out his new textbook, bought by the headmaster with his own money, and peeking at the wanderer, he opened it. He did not see a figurine there. But he saw a subject he had already studied. It was advanced transmutation, which had only recently begun to be studied by the boy. Well, recently, by the new reckoning from the Great Felling, as in a month and a half ago.   Just as Ilya was about to indulge in a self-study on the subject of sleeping with his eyes open, McGonagall, with a predatory grin, levitated a fist-sized wooden cube onto his desk. Turning his head to the right, the kid saw Granger diligently turn the square cube into a leather ball. In fact, this was the pinnacle of advanced transmutation. That is, the double transformation of two opposites of a material, inanimate object. In fact, the first half of the textbook ended on this topic. It turned out their classes were ahead of the program, not by much, literally by a couple of weeks, but ahead. The tricky part was turning wood into leather and a cube into a ball, all at the same time. Well after this theme, there were all sorts of figurative improvements, changes in shape, color, characteristics, and other things. The final exam, where I had to turn a box into some clever shit.    - Hey, uh...   - Oh, Ilya, hi, I didn't see you come in. You probably need help, right? Well, listen, you have to make a wave of the wand like this, like two crosses next to each other, and then say the formula and imagine changing the object. If you want, I...   The boy flinched at the pressure, but then slowly came to his senses, winked at the girl, turned to his cube and voila, he had a small leather ball on the table.    - Actually, I was going to ask "how's it going."   Granger fluttered her eyelashes perplexedly for a while, then pouted.   - I don't talk in class," she muttered and went back to her wooden egg.   Ilya disappointedly exhaled and shook his head sadly, it seems he had offended this wretched girl in some way, but that was beyond the comprehension of a simple boy's heart. Girls are strange creatures. The boy lifted his ball in his hands and waited for McGonagall to look at him. When their gazes met, the boy demonstrated his success and pointed to the back of the desk with a nod of his head. McGee shook her head negatively, flashing her glasses menacingly, indicating that the dialogue was over.    The boy sighed heavily, realizing that he had nothing to complain about. He was already on parole, and if the warden said no bananas, that meant no bananas. But Ilya would not be Ilya if he bent to the changing world. No, the boy, revealing and even defiantly closing the book and putting his ball on top, pulled out of his bag a book, which he had previously brought from the library. The book was interesting, with curious pictures, and new, as yet unexplored, information. In general, Hog's library was a truly posh place. You could find there any magical book ever written, but there was also a lot of Muggle literature. And no one knew how many books were on those countless shelves stretching up to the high ceiling. There were so many books that even if a fire were lit in the library, all the work would burn in only five days.    - Mr. Ilya, what are you doing?   - Reading, ma'am.   - I can see that. What are you reading?   - A book, ma'am.   Yes, Illya enjoyed making fun of the professor. A little revenge. Hmm, maybe he's becoming a Slytherin? Nah, I don't think so, that kind of thing was always his style.    - Which one, Mr. Ilya?   - Quite interesting, ma'am. Of an educational nature.   These words seemed to finally finish off the professor. She stood up from the table, dropping the parchment scrolls on the floor, and walked resolutely to the first desk. With a sharp movement of her hand she snatched the battered book from the boy's hands and peered into the contents. A moment later her eyes went wide, her cheeks flushed and her lips quivered.   - Where did you get this? - she asked, emphasizing the last word   - In the library, ma'am," the boy shrugged.   - And you're not confused by the content?   - Why be embarrassed? They write useful things, and the pictures are great. Actually, I was attracted to the title - "Kama Sutra". That's a tricky word.   Muffled laughter erupted through the room, mixed with coughing. There were a couple of Muggleborns here who seemed to have heard something about this "bible of the bed." Professor McGonagall, still blushing, flipped the book over with misgivings and came across the inscription "Property of Tramp, Lunatic, Eared and Tail."    - I'm confiscating that book from you," McGee cut him off.    - Please," the boy snorted, folding his arms across his chest. - I'm on my third reread anyway.   The cough, in which the boys masked their laughter, sounded louder. The professor's blush grew thicker. Without a word, she returned to the pulpit and tucked the book away in her desk.   - Do you want to read too? - He asked the boy innocently.   Someone couldn't hold back their obvious laughter any longer.   - Mr. Ilya.   - Yeah?   - Have you completed the assignment yet?   - I think so.   - Five points to Slytherin, then, and if you would be so kind as to leave the room.   The boy nodded, gathered his things and threw on his bag. He strode resolutely to the door, but when he was about to disappear into the corridor, his gangster streak suddenly kicked in. He poked his head into the office, as he had done half an hour before, and smiled charmingly.   - Professor, there's some very interesting information on page 15. You might like it.   With those words, the giggling kid, without waiting for an answer, quickly slammed the door and ran down the corridor, reasonably fearing that he might be cursed.       Until the evening, Ilya hung around the castle with nothing to do. After the transfiguration there were flights, where the boy almost killed himself. You see, he decided that he was no worse than Potter, and in his night training he had already succeeded enough to match this bespectacled boy. In general, when Harry-damn-Potter forgotten in the air, which he always does, dived vertically to the ground, performing the feint of some Polish Vronsky, and a couple of inches from the grass leveled a broom, then Ilya decided that he could, as well. It was a laugh... Bosota, seeing that he couldn't level the broom, found nothing better than to "get off at the station", i.e. he trivially jumped off. Surprisingly, the boy got off with a minor scare and a couple of minor bruises, as the broom entered the lawn in a straight line. Three sixth graders were rumored to have pulled out. The kid was charged with forty points, Madame Hooch went to sip her valerian, and the people cackled at the sound of their voices. Any normal twelve-year-old, in Ilya's shoes, would have been offended and retreated into the upper layers of the astral, thinking "all shit, I'm D'Artagnan", but Ilya knew how to act in such situations. He along with everyone else was laughing, and even joking with himself, so that after a couple of hours, no one had no thoughts to remind the best freshman about the unpleasant incident. Laughing at oneself never did any harm.    However, the flights ended, the free time before dinner passed drearily, the dinner itself, which served boiled potatoes and fried ribs, passed pleasantly. The lad ate three portions - until his stomach tightened. "Always eat enough," was a science firmly ingrained in the orphanage wizard's subcortex. After the meal, the Slytherin attempted to arrange some sort of mischief for the Mudblood, but Ilya "pallet" sensing the danger, decided not to go to the dungeons, but to wander around the castle. In general, if you wander around the castle in the evening, you will not see anything except Filch, his mad cat, a couple of ghosts and portraits. The older ones are either in the libraries or in extra classes, well, some walk around the grounds. The younger ones are the same, except for the extra classes. But if you decide to go out at night, you can grab your camera and film some youth comedy. Go up to the Astronomy Tower and you'll get a glimpse of kissing fans in the moonlight. Take a stroll through the abandoned classrooms in the most remote corners of the castle and shoot some softcore porn. And if you come across a hidden room - for example, behind the tapestry on the fifth floor - you can take part in all the general drunkenness, passing either in a soft porn, or in the run from the steward. Generally speaking, Hog's nightlife is a separate topic, not even a kid's topic. Well, what do you want, if for almost a year to lock up guys and girls who have long ago turned sixteen, seventeen, and even eighteen. It is high time to join the sweet pleasures and vices of life.    Alas, no matter how colorful this nightlife was, Ilyas was strictly forbidden to enter it, for the time being. In fact, he, because of his age, did not really want to attend all these entertaining events. So the boy was tormented, not knowing what to do before he had to do his chores. He could, of course, go to his class and study, but for some reason he was in no mood for work. Teasing Slytherins by making them piss boiling water was a bit dangerous now, and the lad did not feel ready for such a pastime. Going to the other faculties' living rooms wasn't exactly a rosy prospect either. After a month of separations, the older girls would probably torture him like a Persian kitten. And the younger ones would be inundated with very "substantial" news. So, soon, the boy found no better option than to get to the sixth floor and sit on the floor in front of Master Char's office. Soon, the boy dozed off.   - Oh, Mr. Ilya," came a slightly mocking voice. Ilya opened his eyes and noticed that he was lying in front of the door, his head resting on his worn bag. - I've never seen anyone sleep under my door before. And so brazenly.   - Smore, Professor," the boy smiled, rising to his feet.    He wasn't the least bit embarrassed by the contrived stare of Flitwick, flashing his glasses and pointy nose. After all, once you've fallen asleep in a doghouse in your underpants alone, hiding from a hostile gang of barefooted men, little things like sleeping under the door don't make you cringe anymore.   - You should sleep more at night," the halfling shook his head as he opened the door of his office.   The professor let the boy go forward, letting him get his bearings. The study was very spacious, an estimation that it could fit two Gryffindor living rooms, the largest living rooms in the castle. Not surprisingly, the lion faculty was traditionally the largest. You look, so most mages in England are noble brave men, only it is unclear then why the Serpentine junta fought so successfully. The room, in which the entire north wall was one big window, was a few desks, a dozen bookshelves filled with even seemingly valuable and expensive folios, in the corners lay whole mountains of scrolls and parchment sheets. Behind the low table was an equally low armchair, upholstered in blue chintz. In spite of the late evening, Filius Flitwick's private study was bright and spacious.    - Come in," the charmer nodded at the nearest desk, on which the shards of the guitar were already lying.   For a moment Ilya was gripped by a fit of frenzied, almost animal rage, but a moment later, the boy was scurrying to the table, pulling a blue tube from his bag as he went. He'd ordered the Magic Ultra Glue from the company Fairyhound - you broke it, we'll fix it last night. The company was German, but the owl brought the order at breakfast anyway. Apparently these winged ones had nothing less than a jet turbine under their ass, otherwise such speed cannot be explained.   The boy landed at his desk, but not on the usual wooden stool, but on a nice chair, with a cushioned seat. Apparently Flitwick had invested heavily in his workhouse. The goblin himself, seated in a miniature chair, took out some drawings, diagrams, a magical calculator, like a calculating machine from the beginning of this century, and set to work, occasionally biting his tongue or scratching a quill in his nostril. The boy somehow chuckled stupidly as he watched this picture, and then he got to work himself.    He decided to take care of the base first, and allotted a week and a half to do so. The hull was shattered except in a small chip, and only the lower arch was relatively intact. So it was really a lot of work. But, as one Russian or Ukrainian (who knows these Slavs) priest used to say, sometimes feeding Ilya's gang - fear the eyes, but do the hands. Sliver by sliver, smearing them with green, sparkling gel, the boy assembled a musical constructor. Each time, piecing together new pieces, Ilya faltered for nearly ten minutes, clutching the broken pieces with all his might. The boy could not stand potboiler in matters that directly affect him or his family. So if you have to repair your own tool, you have to work with heart, patience and dedication. So it is not surprising that half an hour before going to bed, the boy's hands were shaking and his fingers were shining with splinters, and the repair has progressed only a small fraction of the total amount of work.    Picking splinters out of his palms, the boy glanced at the panting Flitwick, who was clearly counting something. Soon, however, he shrieked happily, flicked the calculator over and wrote down the result. And a moment later, he frowned again. Ilya could not contain his curiosity.   - Professor, what are you doing? - the freshman politely inquired.    The enchantment master raised his head, eyeing his apprentice with mild reproach, then sighed heavily and removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose.   - Madame Hooch has asked me to design new protective charms for the broomstaff.    Ilya's heart began to race and goose bumps ran down his back.   - What for?   - Yeah, well... Some student has a habit of dragging brooms around at night. He's not picking locks with magic, but with Muggle picks.    - What a cunning fellow," whistled the bosun, who had got hold of himself.    - That's my point," the familiar predatory smile distorted the teacher's features for a moment, making him look, well, very much like a goblin. - The little weasel steals brooms instead of sleeping, flies Mordred around, then puts them back where they belong. And neither Filch nor his cat can catch the sly one. Don't you find that rather curious, Mr. Ilya?   - Of course Professor, I admire the workmanship of this unknown.    - Yeah, I'll give him credit for that. But you know what, Mr. Ilya, while you were in the hospital for a month, the thefts had miraculously stopped.   - Surprisingly, Professor," the boy stretched out. - The unknown man must have had a lot of flying to do.   - Oh, that's what I thought too. But then you recovered, and the very next night, Madame Hooch discovered again that someone had taken the brooms.   - Truly, Hogwarts is a place of miracles.    The enchantment master hummed and rubbed the stiff neck.   - That's what I'm saying, Mr. Ilya, you should sleep more and I'd have less work to do.   - But you do like to cast a spell against this weasel," the cheeky boy smiled.   - Right," and that predatory smile again. - But if I do catch, as you put it, this weasel, I'll take two hundred, no, three hundred points off him.   - And if you don't?   - If I don't catch him by the end of the year, then the next year, the crook will be in for a pleasant surprise.   - What a tempting bet," Ilya shook his head, hiding rather sparkling eyes. - I wish I were the one to take part in it.    The professor only sighed heavily, showing how much he cared about it all, and then looked at his watch. It was nearly nine o'clock already, which meant it was time to not set foot out of the living rooms. In principle, Hog didn't have a time off after which everyone should be blowing bubbles while lying in bed, but after nine, anyone caught outside the walls of their faculty would get a well-deserved punishment. Deserved punishment because he was caught.    - I see the work isn't moving very fast," the professor nodded at the nearly undiminished pile of splinters.    - I have nowhere to hurry," the boy shrugged, pulling out the last of the splinter. His palms were now chickenpox-covered, with tiny red dots, and the base itself, at the seams of the repair, had a strange, greenish hue. Probably from the blood mixed with the glue.    - Don't you like to play? - The halfling wondered.   - I love it," the boy nodded. - Very much so. But if I fix it wrong, the sound will be bad, or there won't be any sound at all. So I'd rather hang around for a month or a month and a half and get it right. And besides, it's such a long break from the music... All in all, I think I'll be distracted by nothing else but musicianship for the whole Christmas break.   - Um, as always, I'm glad to know that you're not just smart from books. I confess, every time I give you points in my class, I wish I had given them to a student in my department.   - Speaking of which," the boy was suddenly, unexpectedly, embarrassed. - Professor, why are you spending so much time and energy helping a Slytherin?   The professor smiled warmly and tossed the chewed feather into the bin where there was a big pile of them.   - Mr. Ilya, a real teacher does not divide his students into faculties. Rather, it's the students themselves who need the divisions. And we, the professors, have to take care of everyone equally.    - But...   - Oh, Ilya, I am amazed at you. Sometimes you show great insight and brilliant deduction, but when it comes to you personally, you turn into an average freshman. You can see that you are regarded by some teachers with suspicion, almost hostility, so I feel obliged to alleviate that factor. You don't mind, do you?   - Not at all, sir!   - That's good. And now, before I let you go, I have one last question-what do you intend to do with your classmates?   - Nothing sir," Ilya applied the skill - "innocent face", which even the same priest, called a true angelic face, and certainly priests know a lot about angels.   - Mr. Ilya, as the Muggles say, don't bullshit me. Haven't you had enough work for a month?   - But you see what they did to her! - The boy didn't hold back, pointing his finger at his practically destroyed six-string friend.    - Mr. Ilya," Flitwick said in an unusually firm tone that did not tolerate any bickering. The normally cheeky, even impudent boy was instantly embarrassed. - You must remember, this is not your Refuge and, thank Merlin, not Scary Square. I've heard rumors about this place, so I'm quite comfortable with all your shenanigans. After all, you can't expect a fish to start flying through the sky.    The boy wanted to show off his erudition and declare that there were flying fish, but refrained from such a bold statement, and the professor continued his lecture.   - But I will not tolerate overt self-mutilation. Fighting and stabbing, that's not going to do any good.    - But...   Then the professor, with a smooth movement of his wand, silently levitated a parchment scroll onto the desk of his student and nodded encouragingly. The boy unwrapped the peculiar parcel and read the beautiful, calligraphic handwriting.    "Domestic spells, general knowledge.   ...the ripping of the clothes.   ... Enodo is a spell that unties knots of any complexity.   ...Capillum summittere-- a spell for hair growth.   ..."   And about two dozen other fairly simple charms, too, given the patterns of their strokes and the simplicity of their formulas. The boy looked up in bewilderment at the predatory grin on the professor's face.   - Mr. Ilya, you have already demonstrated your intelligence, insight and deductive talent, but I am not yet familiar with your imagination. Perhaps you will find some use for that knowledge. For now, you should go back to the drawing-room, if you don't want Filch to rain his waters of eloquence down on your head.    Gerber just nodded, carefully put the scroll in a separate pocket in the main compartment, now empty, brushed off the tube of glue, and got out from behind the desk and headed for the door. Just as he was about to leave, Flitwick called out to him.   - Ilya, I hope you realize that you found this scroll entirely by accident, say... in that pile over there.   - Uh, yes, Professor, I don't know why I reached out to him. Curiosity, I guess.   - Yes," the grinning halfling nodded. - Curiosity is your chief weapon at the moment.    The boy nodded again, shining his bright, blue eyes, and was about to leave, when he realized that he forgot to say the "ritual" phrase, to which, most likely, he would get the usual "ritual" answer.   - Thank you, Professor.   - You're welcome, Mr. Ilya. Absolutely nothing.    Closing the door behind him, hearing the counting machine in the study once more rattling, Ilya, clutching his bag to his chest as if it held all the wealth in the world, hurried to the secret staircase leading to the first floors. But if you thought the lad was going back to the drawing-room, you do not know Ilya well. No, he wasn't going down to the snake's den at all. The freshman was in a hurry to get to class number "22". His heart demanded an immediate start in the study of such curious charms, and the lad was powerless to resist that call.      December 16, 1991. Hogwarts       Today, on the Monday of the last week of term, the madness at Hogwarts began to run rampant. And that same madness, in some bizarre way, was only affecting Slytherin's first year. It began at breakfast, which was successfully disrupted by the fact that Draco Malfoy's hair had mysteriously turned into a cactus, and Daphne Greengrass had acquired a lush cow udder. The children, squealing (witnesses can't remember who squealed more, Greengrass or Malfoy) and pushing each other, hurried to Madam Pomfrey, who nullified the effects of some elaborate potions in five minutes. The Slytherins sinned at the denying Twins, not even suspecting the culprit of this deed - the hatchet-toting, pale-faced leader of the non-existent Power of the Mongoose organization, the great leader of the Grey Feather, Ilya Ilya.    It took exactly a week and almost one hundred and eighty hours of work to master the simplest household spells at a decent level. Actually, the boy wanted to spend more than that on them - preferably the entire Christmas break and the month after, but the snakes were really annoying. Every day, every single day, these refined pseudo-aristocrats were trying to mess with their classmate somehow. Most often they failed - saved the pallet flair, but sometimes Ilya still fell for their tricks. The most innocuous thing he survived this week was hanging upside down for an hour before the spell weakened. After that, he had a headache for three hours. But there came a day when each of the twenty-five spells had been practiced enough to give his much-adored classmates a good time.    - Ilya, are you ready for the test? - She smiled at the boy, who was wearing some sort of crazy-colored sweatshirt under her robe today.    - Of course not! - The blue-eyed boy squealed in feigned fright. - Do we have a test today?   - Yeah," Lavender chuckled. - The final one for the semester.   - Merlin," the boy sobbed. - McGee is going to eat me.   The not-so-golden trio, Brown, Parvati and McDougal, laughed and made their way to the classroom, where the students of the two faculties were already gathered. On their faces, well, on the faces of almost everyone present, one thing was written - "It's not my fault, please let me go to my mum". Yeah, the Iron Lady's quiz was torture. Tough questions, plus a very tough test. If you get less than a "Y," you can kiss your ten points goodbye and get ready for evening practice. Even the devils would have cried out and repented of all their sins.    Ilya, spitting over his shoulder for good luck - as the Slavic priest had taught him, entered the classroom. His forthcoming mission was complicated by the fact that the boy was still sitting in the front row - it was like being right under the eye of Sauron, staring into your soul. And then there was that nerdy Danger, the local Golum, not knowing what to expect, but secretly counting on the worst. But the bosota, with kamikaze determination, moved towards the disposition of his exile (or subplot, depending on how you look at it). Granger gave the Slytherin an unaccustomedly unpleasant look and even moved away slightly. It was unpleasant, apparently Weatherby's perpetual cries of meanness and other vices of all Greens in general and Ilya in particular, could affect the outlook of not only a person, but even ... a monument. Still, the boy's kind heart, was glad that the infinitely lonely Danger, had found herself in the formed Golden Trio. Friends are important.    When the bell rang, rattling like an undertaker's alarm bell, McGee slid her list of questions onto everyone's desk. Ilya, opening the scotch-taped inkpot and exposing a crumpled, frayed quill like a sword, began to read the questions carefully. Apparently the Dean of Scarlet had not forgotten the kid's antics, so among the seven questions, he found "define transmutation". Well, it was necessary to keep the mark of not getting lower than "P", so the guy immediately began to answer properly. And Ilya's rules, from his Muggle school days, were as follows - twenty percent for facts from the textbook on the subject, twenty percent for facts from additional literature, forty percent for analysis and his conclusions, five percent for the boldest speculation and fifteen percent of the selected "water". "Water" was needed to make the answer lively and interesting, not a dry quotation of books, like that of Granger. Of the allotted one and a half hours to work, Ilya spent exactly an hour, and the next thirty minutes, carefully developing a plan. According to Ilya's plan, revenge should be elegant, beautiful, and have nothing to do with self-harm. Losing a good relationship with Flitwick, Illya wanted to.   - Let's turn in our work! - Abruptly she cut McGonagall off as the last grain of sand in her watch, which stood on the left corner of the desk, crawled from the upper compartment, to the lower compartment.    At that very moment, the people, some sadly, some relieved, rose from their seats and, gathering their things, lined up in several columns, turning in their sheets. On the left side, where the Slytherin column stood, the first to go were the hot (or rather, she will be, in about five years) Latino Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, the bulldog-faced skank who, if you met her in a dark alleyway at night, would be mistaken for a banshee at best. Well, the goals were fixed, and all that remained was to fulfill the destiny. Ilya turned his head, unnoticed by the others, examining the surroundings. Hermione was lecturing to the blushing Potter and Weatherby, surely half the questions had failed, the others whispering quietly, warily looking at the professor's chair. There couldn't have been a better chance. The boy pulled himself together, no longer even paying attention to the fever rising in his heart, and concentrated. He wasn't as adept at domestic enchantments as he was at the levitation spell, so the multiple enchantments, in this case, were quite a challenge. But the lad wasn't about to back down. He held his wand at his hip, so that it didn't peek out from under the desk, and made a wavy swing, as if trying to mop up something.   - Maculus," the boy whispered, casting a simple spell to remove the smudges. The thing about spells was that if you put more power into them than necessary, they would make the smudges disappear...   - Miss Zabini! Miss Parkinson! Why are you handing me blank sheets? - ...McGee seemed outraged and perplexed, ready to choke to death.   - What?   - No!   The girls squealed and hurriedly stared at their papers, but there really wasn't a single line except for the questions. Ilya wiped away the sweat. To make it so that only the recent records disappeared, and the old ones remained, was not easy and required many hours of hard training. Yes, the Twins must be some kind of genius wizards (but they are in code) if they can pull off so many tricks.    - What a defiant impudence! - the professor was furious. - Minus thirty points... each! And a week's worth of late nights!   - But Professor," a bewildered Zabini pleaded. - It's vacation in a week.   - Then you'll be working until the holidays! And I'll talk to Professor Snape about your behaviour. No, that's rude...   The Gryffidorians were teasing, and Weatherbee was getting all hot and bothered about "Serves 'em right, vipers. He's a revolutionary, though he can't stand aristocrats, though he's a thoroughbred, so he'd be advocating "government to the workers and collective farmers. From there, the change went smoothly, and the boy handed in his work with a sense of accomplishment. Zabini and Bulldog muzzle, walking out of the classroom, holding back tears as best they could - a conversation with Snape is not like confessing to the padre, but rather making a deal with the devil. Greengrass was holding them by the shoulders, flashing her eyes down the corridor, where the bulk of the people were already spreading out, streaming off into all sorts of offshoots. For a moment, the pretty girl's gaze lingered on Ilya, but soon the trio was gone. He was a little girl, but soon he was gone. Actually, Hogwarts had a lot of trinity: the Golden Girls at Gryff, Malfoy and his dubolomas, Lavender and Co, Diggory and his minions, God, you can go on and on. He was a bit of a jerk, but he was so disappointed in the muggles that they believed in them for almost two thousand years now.    - Ilya," someone's weak, soft hand firmly grasped the boy's palm and yanked him toward the dark corner.   - Yes, yes, Granger," the Slytherin smirked on his face, the kind of grin that usually put all girls his age into a blush, but such tricks had no effect on the nerd. The lady was impenetrable. Though if you ripped up Hogwarts History in front of her, you might have a fit.    Behind the girl stood a bespectacled man and a redhead, and while the girl was clearly pissed off, the guys were completely indifferent to any sort of problem. The main stream of students had already disappeared, and McGonagall had left for the upper floors, levitating a stack of parchment sheets behind her - hurrying to her office. So it was a little unclear why Ilya had been so brazenly detained, though there was some not-so-happy speculation, nonetheless.   - I saw it was you," the girl said clearly.   - I... what?   - You're the one who messed up Zabini and Parkinson's answers!   "King Arthur - we've been burned," was the desperate thought beating in the mind of the prowler.    - I don't know what you mean," Ilya shrugged, retaining the poker face he'd honed over the years of playing for food.    - Don't lie," the girl was still holding his hand. - We could see you staring at the girls, your hand twitching as if you were moving something, and your lips moving.   - Granger is Granger," the boy shook his head. - You didn't think I was just trying to pull a fast one, did you? Zabini's all right, though, and next to Parkinson, she's a Playboy babe.    - Shall I? - The girl arched an eyebrow in puzzlement.   - Well, uh, yes, to twitch," the boy made a very unambiguous movement in the air and looked hopefully at the boys. - Well, at least you can explain to her...   But Potter and Weasley had the same look of utter bewilderment in their eyes. Ilya sighed and slapped his right hand to his face with a drawl. These homeboys would have him in his grave before his fellow soldiers had a chance to get their hands on him.    - Hermione, leave him alone." Oh, my God, what a bear in the woods that Weatherby had stood up for the slimeball. - After all, we're better off-the slugs have lost points.   Nah, it's just natural pettiness, but what else would you expect from this appendage to a shaggy-haired hero.   - Ron, don't you get it? It's despicable.   - And I'm a Slytherin, so I'm allowed," Ilya snickered. - And anyway, Granger, do you like holding my hand that much?   Hermione blushed rapidly and pulled her paw back, quickly hiding it behind her back.   - So you're confessing, are you? We're telling McGonagall right now!   The guy even stopped breathing for a second, so you do good to people, and then that same good will turn around and punch you in the face. It's so disgusting to talk to people like that, who are willing to snitch. Ilya even grimaced, as if they threw a dung heap under his nose. But then he decided that if they were trying to trick him by blackmailing him by snitching, he might as well do the same.    - Go ahead, Hussars," the handsome boy shrugged. - I'll go to the Headmaster and tell him I saw you in the Forbidden Hall after midnight, and that you were there when you escaped from the Hall of Rewards, where an illegal duel was about to take place. It may not be an expulsion, but it'll take two hundred points off each of you. Where does that leave your faculty? It seems to me it's in the deepest shit.   - You wouldn't dare! - shouted Weatherby, Harry just glared angrily.    - Then you'll have to tell the principal what you were doing there yourself," Hermione snorted.   - No problem," the boy smiled, preparing for another bluff. It was a pleasure, though, to be bluffed. - I have the perfect excuse. Filch had kept me late to work that day for running around the halls, so I was late.   - But that's not what you said," the nerd said in a husky voice. She believed me.   - And I lied to you," the boy shrugged.   Weasley cursed foully, remembering all the Slytherins, Potter looked confused, and Granger somehow suddenly gathered her wits.   - And why should I believe you're not lying now?   - No reason - you can check it out. You just tell me when you're going to McGonagall's, so I'll head to Dumbledore's at the same moment.    Granger scrutinized the boy for a while, then turned away. Victory was on Green's side today. The girl headed toward her friends, but halfway turned around.   - Ron was right-- you're scum.   - Says the Gryffindor girl who threatened to snitch on the Professor," Ilya sighed mournfully.   - You broke the rules! You framed two girls!   No, this conversation had finally spoiled the boy's mood, and lunch was just around the corner, and skipping a meal was the last thing to do.   - Hey, Cipollino the librarian, what do you take me for? I don't give a shit about what you're complaining about. You got a problem with that? Well, take your Chip and Dale and get out of here.    Granger's lips quivered and she took off, hurtling down the corridor. Weatherby blushed, becoming a natural tomato, and grabbed his wand, but he was stopped by Potter and nodded in the direction of the departing one. Weasley struggled with himself for a while, but then he glared in Ilya's direction and raced off with Scarface, catching up with his friend. Despite the fact that Ilya thought he was absolutely right, the situation made him a little upset. He, in his usual naivety, thought that he could have a good relationship with the whole castle, not counting the Slytherins, but apparently ill will comes by chance and not by smiling or willing to help their neighbors. Well, the only thing left to do is to give up on the problem and throw the hatchet over his shoulder and go on, taking holy revenge...      That evening, Flitwick's office.      - You're saying this rogue mixed a musk tincture, added a triroga liver and stirred vigorously with a ladle?   - I think so.   - Oh, quite a curious effect. Think about it-- cow's udder. You'd think, where would it come from?   - I think the patsy thought the same thing.    Ilya was sitting in Flitwick's office, drinking tea with him. I must say, it was delicious, aromatic tea, with a choice of cakes and chocolate chip cookies to go with it. Apparently, professors are supplied with food by the housekeepers separately. For today, the work was done with, on the desk already lay a partially restored base, sparkling with scarlet-green streaks. Filius had also completed his scientific research, and so he poured tea early. Already the next day, after the momentous day when the lad had received the scroll, the professor would have these sorts of gatherings. Sometimes they just chatted about nothing, or rather it was Ilya who chatted, swinging his legs in the air, the chair was too high, and the charmer master listened to him calmly, sometimes praising and sometimes scolding him for really dishonorable deeds. The boy never argued in case Flitwick began to make a long speech about honor and dignity. After all, Ilya is no longer a juvenile outlaw with a record of Pharaohs, but a novice wizard, so he should behave himself. So Ilya was deeply grateful to the old halfling, who could always make you think, and in a moment make you laugh.    - I heard there was another incident today," Flitwick took a sip of his tea and popped a liver into his mouth.   - Yeah," the boy nodded, smiling happily as he milled his bouchette. - Just imagine, Zabini and Parkinson's ink disappeared while they were taking a test.   - Yes, unpleasant incident. And Professor McGonagall? How did she feel about the pristine clean sheet?   - And he wasn't pristine," the kind smile transformed into a sly one.   - Hmmm," the professor stretched, twirling the cup on the saucer. - Did the rogue leave the text of the questions untouched?   - I think so.   - Nice trick! Too bad I can't award points for it.    Ilya, still smiling, reached for more sweets, the professor just moved the vase closer to him. For some time more, Flitwick listened to the little weasel's somewhat confused account of his day. In many ways, it resembled a conversation between a parent and an open-minded child, but Ilya didn't understand that; he had nothing to compare it to. However, he liked such gatherings, very much. When the tea finished, Master Char looked at his watch and saw that it was almost nine o'clock. He had to let his apprentice go before the grumpy squib could catch him. After letting his child finish his tea, Flitwick swung his wand to empty the cups and put them together with the vase into the sideboard. The boy only exhaled in surprise. Two different spells in one motion, and yet without words - an incredible level.    - It's time for you to go, Mr. Ilya. Filch doesn't doze off.   - I wish I could.   The boy gathered his things, and rose from the table, heading for the door.   - Mr. Ilya, I don't know if you're aware of this, but last night I installed a new spell on the broomstaff.   - Oh, wow," all the boy said.   This was followed by the customary "ritual" of thanksgiving and the boy slipped into a dark corridor lit only by ancient torches. Without wasting time, Ilya threw his bag on his shoulder and hurried to the secret passages and stairs that led him to the ground floor. It was here that the broomstick warehouse was located. As always, on a Monday night, the boy was going to practice his flying skills and no charms should stop him.    Like a cat, Ilya crept around the first floor. He winced at any intruding sound and sprinted from armor to armor, hiding behind it. Soon he saw a service room, the door of which was locked with a heavy lock. That wasn't much of a problem, though, but the new enchantment was. The boy guessed exactly what the cheerful professor was putting in his invention, so he himself was not yawning and had honed a new system of penetration over the days.    - Wingardium Leviossa," Ilya whispered, making a smooth swing of his wand.   The lock was a long, curved strip of metal, which was the lockpick that fitted the lock perfectly. Wasting no time, the boy, standing at a respectful distance from the door, lapped the lockpick to the lock. With a careful movement he inserted it into the hole and with the power of his mind began to scroll there. When the first click sounded and the tension increased, it was as if the boy had "added" a new picklock to the spell. He held it up to the lock and raised all the prongs in one motion. The arc snapped out of its groove and the lock was about to collapse to the ground, but it too was "added" to the spell and neatly floated to the thief. Ilya didn't dare touch the metal with his hands, so he magically removed it into his bag. The path was clear. The boy took a step forward, but immediately froze. The puzzle was too easy to open. It's like in maths - if it seems too easy, you don't understand something. Opening the door with the same lioness, the boy drew a roll of cloth from his bag. It wasn't silk or brocade, but it didn't look like much more than canvas. Not the usual stuff, though, costing three shekels a foot. The thing about cloth was that it had the power to isolate magic. Not to destroy, hide, conceal or anything, but to isolate. In fact, it was used to store artifacts, wrapped in a cloth like this, you could transport it in anything. For thirty feet of such cloth, the boy paid almost three galleons, honestly won from the Hufflepuffs in poker.    Magically rolling out an impressive-sized roll (the boy's bag Flitwick had somehow cleverly enchanted, and now he could almost hide a whole armor in it, and it would only weigh about three kilos more), the boy strode across it like a red carpet to the broomsticks. With the help of the remaining piece of cloth, he grabbed the shaft and, holding his breath, removed it from the rack. A minute passed, two, five, but nothing happened. Well, then, today would be a day of mono...      December 22, 1991. Hogwarts, Snape's study.        The boy sat in that awful, cramped room, reeking of potions, alchemical muck, and stale sweat. In comparison, Flitwick's office was like an airy cloud of light, whereas Snape's dwelling was like a dungeon. It was damp, uncomfortable. By the eastern wall was a table, lined with various vials and bottles, beside which were two simple chairs and a royal armchair, of course - Snape's. To the left of the entrance were stacks of books and a couple of cupboards containing some sort of dried abomination. To the left were two cauldrons and a whole rack full of different jars, which contained the now-inspired abominations. Ilya, sitting on an uncomfortable, hard chair, felt awful. All those feelings he had felt sitting in Potions class had increased tenfold, and now it was worth great effort not to vomit and run away from here away. And the fucking dean was also late for a meeting he'd set up himself. Still, the boy could guess why he'd been summoned to the carpet. The head slug was probably worried about the youngsters, and rightly so. Those daddy's sons and daughters were having a fun week.     During this week, not a single breakfast passed without the freshman with a green coat of arms on his chest, something did not grow, disappear, or change color or shape. In the classroom and then there was some mishap, from the traditional disappeared ink, to the fact that the pen began to lead its own life, and the life full of aggression to its owner. In flying lessons, many people were glued to the ground and hurt trying to take off. Shoelaces on shoes that untied themselves, and then tied each other - became the norm. Suddenly, while sipping pumpkin juice, you could hit an orange-colored iceberg with your teeth. Or gobbling sweets, suddenly realizing it was more of a pickle. But the final comedy for some and tragedy for others was yesterday's incident.   Ilya was coming down the stairs when he noticed this picture - Daphne Greengrass, holding the hand of Blaze Zabini, was leading her somewhere, telling her something enthusiastically along the way. A plan sprang up in the boy's mind instantly. There was no one else in the vicinity, so the boy made up his mind instantly. He followed the girls closely, and when they turned into the main corridor, he threw two petrification on their backs. The girls froze. But that wasn't the end of it. Ilya applied a gluing spell to their arms, causing them to stick together as if they had been fused together. Then he used a tearing spell on their clothes. The girls were left completely naked and it was only a few minutes before the bell rang. As much as the growing boy's desire to go around the frozen figures and look at more than just the sirloin was great, there was work to be done. The boy, in a couple of minutes, managed to cast a dozen more charms. Those had no effects at all, but if someone wanted to, and someone would definitely want to, apply Finite, he would have to cast the canceling spells a dozen times to unfreeze the girls, and then remove the gluing spells.    The bell rang, and dozens, almost a hundred students came out into the corridor, and they all saw a very interesting sight. The spells were off in about five minutes, but they never got to the glue guy. As soon as Petrificus was asleep, the girls howled and tried to run - and in different directions. Of course, the aristocrats collapsed on the floor and began to roll around like a fit. McGonagall rescued the situation. She removed the rest of the spells, put the ladies enchanted capes, and led the weeping, white as snow, Slytherin to Madame Pomfrey. And there was a full house in the corridor. Many of the younger boys were red as a crayfish, and Weasley's nose was about to bleed from overexcitement. The girls giggled maliciously and the older ones laughed like horses. It was the finish line.   And so today, as Ilya was sitting in the library, contemplating another trick, Snape burst into the room and ignoring Mrs. Pince's laments, dragged his ward by the scruff of the neck to his office. Snape, ignoring Mrs. Pince's lamentations, burst into the room, dragging his ward off to his study, without letting him think, for the door slammed behind him, and he shot up to the desk, looking like an enormous bat.    - Mr. Ilya!" he growled, slamming his hands on the table.   - Yes Professor," the boy said calmly.   - What are you doing, you naughty boy?! Do you even have a head on your shoulders?!   - I don't know what you mean, Professor.   - Don't you see?! - Snape roared like a wounded bison. At least he doesn't hiss. If the dean hissed, it was over, but if he hissed, it was all right. - Look me in the eye, you little brat!   - I'm not going to," the boy shook his head. - And anyway, you have no right to use leglimene on me.   The boy, keeping his word to himself, found everything he could about telepathy. There were two sections - leglimancy, the science of penetrating another's consciousness, and occlusion, the science of protecting that very consciousness. The boy only undertook the latter section, since the rudiments of honor, inculcated by Flitwick, did not allow the child to take up lelegmancy. It seemed to Illyevo that digging into other people's minds was even more disgusting than taking a girl without her consent. But, over many months, the boy never advanced in his research. He already knew how to clear his mind freely, which was seriously helpful in his studies, but he was not good at building mental shields. He could sweat, tear his hair, and make himself bleed from his nose, but not even a single brick of the imaginary stone wall, the simplest of defenses, wanted to fall into place. It was as if nature itself had failed to instill in the wizard any capacity for this very occlusion. So for a week now the boy had given up the useless task of not looking those damned telepaths in the eye. But back to our bars... Snapes.   It seemed to Ilya that his bold statement had cooled the professor's ardor, at least he no longer twisted his face and even sat down in a chair.    - Ilya, do you realize what you've done?   - I still don't know what you mean.   - That's enough! Enough, Ilya! We're not in a circus, and you're not a clown. You know exactly what I mean. Just tell me, how, Mordred, how did you get the idea to do this to Miss Greengrass and Miss Zabini?! Have you lost all touch with reality?   Then a vague suspicion started to enter the boy's mind and he turned a little pale.   - Uh, what are you talking about, Professor?   - Oh," the potter grinned wickedly. - Now I see you're not clowning around anymore. Well, Mr. Ilya, let's face it. Who are you? That's right, nobody. And who are the two ladies you've embarrassed - they're daughters of major aristocratic families, dating back as far as the Roman Empire's conquest of the British Isles. I can see by your pale face that you can guess why I was so eager to drag you into my study and why it took me so long to show up. Yes, you are right in your guess, just now I saved your life, Mr. Ilya, not directly, which is good, but indirectly.    - Seniors," Ilya whispered, realizing that he hadn't taken the reaction of the older Slytherin boys into account at all.   - Exactly, Ilya, exactly. I, or rather you, was lucky enough to hear some rather gifted wizards from the sixth and seventh years whispering. If I hadn't heard that, you would have had an accident tonight that would have resulted in you breaking your neck on the school stairs in such an unfortunate way.    The situation wasn't even "half-assed," it was really "asshole. Ilya seemed to have lost his sense of smell when he got to Hogwarts, and was careless enough to swim in the shark's waters. Maybe he shouldn't have gone that far. Although... ...you should have. They want to kill me? Let them. They ain't the first, they ain't the last. How many assholes like him have come through St. Frederic's orphanage wanting Ilya's blood? How many times had he gone one-on-one with the big bososoms, holding nothing but his butterfly. And he's alive, well, well, where are those big guys now? They've got fake teeth and long scars.   - Bummer for your slugs," Ilya growled, clutching his wand and knife in his hands.   - Ilya, you, sad to say, grew up to be a complete fool," Snape sighed. - Anyway, listen to me. I have spoken to the faculty. When the students return from the holidays, you will no longer be hindered by anyone. In return, you will no longer terrorize your classmates and make the faculty lose points. Slytherin was neck and neck with Ravenclaw before this mournful week, fighting for first place, but now we're dragging ourselves down to the very bottom. So consider your status quo restored.    Severus exhaled, rubbing his temples not immediately noticing Ilya smiling quite predatorily at something. It was as if the boy was glowing from within.   - I don't know what you're excited about. You've been walking on a razor blade!   - I don't walk on it," the boy hummed. - I've been living on it since I was born. And joy... as much as I hate to admit it, Professor, one dirty little boy did Slytherin in. You can say what you like, but I won the war.   Snape stared into the boy's eyes for a long moment, not even trying to get into his mind. And the boy didn't take his eyes off resolutely, as if inviting them into his head.    - I don't understand how you ended up in my department. You would have been more suited to Gryffindor.   - It wasn't even offered to me," the boy shrugged and hurried out of the awful office.    After closing the door behind him, the boy went at a hopping pace to the upper floors, where he was going to share the joy of victory with the esteemed Professor Flivik. In the end, all was well. He was back in the status of an untouchable outcast, and ahead of him almost a month of vacation, during which he can do whatever he wants, and as much as he wants. Well, life is beautiful, and when you're alive, it's twice as beautiful. Chapter 6   Chapter 6.       (p.a. leave a comment, anyone reading this. Spend two minutes of your time throwing a slipper or "thank you" to the author.)           December 26, 1991 Hogwarts, Slytherin Lounge   Ilya, sitting in the chair across the fireplace, racked his head. There was little more than no one left in the Castle, on holiday. Witherby and the Greatest Spectacles of the Universe (and that was by no means Dumbledore) were at Vulture, with only Ilya in Slytherin, and a few other students from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. And so, yesterday, on the 25th of December, Christmas Day, all fourteen people living at the moment in the castle gathered around one table to celebrate the bright, Muggle holiday. Which, surprisingly, was celebrated by all wizards. Another paradox - hello to Master Ollivander. In principle, the celebration was fun and cheerful. Director acted as a cheerful toastmaster, amusing everyone with his spontaneity, bordering on infantile. Adding color to the mix was the insane Trelawney, who was hosting such a curious subject as Prediction. Curious, because it, in Ilya's opinion, could only be attended by people lost to society and incompetent. The highlight of the program was a grim Snape, who blew a clapper, at Dumbledore's tacit insistence, acquired a pink bonnet. Ilya wished he had a camera, he'd have made a fortune on the cards. In the evening the party was over, the headmaster left, flashing his surreal absurd hat, which also appeared out of a firecracker. Everyone dispersed to their corners, eager either to sleep or to attend to urgent matters.   Ilya went down to the dungeons and walked into the living room, which was as empty as Goyle's head. The boy skillfully lit the fireplace, sat down in an armchair, and opened a book. Somehow, unbeknownst to Ilya, a dessert table materialized next to him, with a mug of hot chocolate and a vase of cookies on it. Either the departed Flitwick was a godsend in spells, or the house elves, whom the lad had never seen before, had decided to give a gift to the lonely Slytherin. Sharpening his treat and perusing another Muggle creation, the boy almost dozed off, but somehow, unexpectedly, a burnt log in the fireplace clicked and the lad woke up. He shook his head, pushing the sleep away, and then stumbled on a picture with a seascape slightly shifted aside. Ilya got up, deciding he needed to fix the mess before he left. But what was his surprise when behind the landscape he found... a bar. Apparently in a peculiar alcove, the elders stored booze. Not a creamy beer, which looked more like a milkshake, but fortified wine and firewhiskey. The kid pondered for a while, and then decided that, damn it, he was twelve and tail already and needed to get some important life experiences. Although, he had never celebrated a birthday in his life. And how can he celebrate, if there is not even a birth certificate, only a certificate when Ilya was found on the doorstep of the shelter. And he did not want to consider this day - October 5th, his birthday. So the boy reasonably believed that he was born somewhere in the middle of September, and that's why he missed a whole year of study in Hoge, having been admitted here at almost twelve years old. By the way, it was the same situation with Danger, but she was a couple of weeks younger than Ilya.   Now, back to the bar. The boy pulled out a bottle of amber liquid, but not as dark as cognac. With difficulty unscrewing the cap, the boy splashed the hot chocolate into the fireplace and poured himself a full cup. He'd done it for nothing. Ilya was a stubborn and self-confident teenager, so after taking the first sip and almost swallowing, while simultaneously tearing his throat with his fingernails and rolling his eyes out of their orbits, he did not spit out the liquid. It took him half an hour to gulp down the whole mug, frantically sharpening his biscuits, and then the boy looked at the bottle with a strange, frantic gleam in his hazy eyes. What happened next would remain only in the legends of the housekeepers.   So we go back to that morning, when Ilya woke up in the women's wing (which, purely theoretically, was impossible to reach). I was in a state of shock, holding my head, holding back my gagging, and he moved to the bathroom, where he spent a long time soaking under a cold shower. He seemed to feel better. After that, the young alcoholic moved into the living room and plunged into an armchair, languishing with headache. A migraine and a terrible dryness in the throat, tormented the boy for another couple of hours, during which he drank a couple of liters of water and five times ran to the "white friend". And what was the boy's surprise when in the far corner of the living room, where there stood a sprawling ornate spruce, he saw under its hem two gift wrapped packages with blue ribbons. Clearly - they were gifts to Ilya, after all, he was the only one left of the green, but from whom, he could not understand.   Rising from his settled position, the lad moved toward his target, occasionally giving an intricate hook. Soon Ilya flopped down on his heel, sitting up stoop-style, and pulled the first, smallest roll up to him. The boy carefully removed the wrapper, just in case it would come in handy, and then stared dumbfounded at the cover of the shabby textbook.   - "Animagia for Beginners," the kid read.   The book was accompanied by a letter, sealed with a red seal with a picture of a shield and a sword. The freshman opened it immediately.   "Good morning, Mr. Ilya.   I hasten to congratulate you on a wonderful and bright holiday. I would like to wish you everything that people usually wish, but, I'm afraid, you want to get everything on your own, without looking back at other people's wishes. So, knowing your love for the "Tales of Earthmoor" (thanks by the way - great book) I give you this textbook, hoping for your prudence and healthy craving for risk.   Merry Christmas, Mr. Ilya!   P.S. You're welcome, Ilya. Absolutely not."       The boy smiled happily as he ran his hand over the old textbook and tucked the professor's letter into his pocket. It really was a good gift for a half-grown man. That was all the boy could ask for. Ilya for some time fought the urge to immediately open the work and plunge into reading, but still reached for the next gift. That one was heavy and even weighty. The boy carefully took off the wrapping and could not believe his eyes. It was a magic counting machine, just like Flitwick's, but the latest model from Cypherus. Those chrome levers, protruding keys of numbers and symbols, a small pad above which magically, hovering in the air as if a hologram, appeared numbers entered and numbers received. The most difficult examples from "Numerology. Compose Your Spell", on which the boy used to spend many hours, would now be solved much more quickly. But who made such an undeniably expensive and necessary gift? The boy was already racking his brains, lost in speculation, when he noticed a note attached to the machine's stand.   "You've opened up new horizons for me!"   The boy sat for some time in the highest degree of shock, which has an obscene naivety, and could not comprehend the meaning of the note in any way. And then suddenly he began to laugh wildly, wiping the tears that had come out of laughter. Ilya remembered how the day before the holiday dinner, reached the principal's office and put the jaws of the gargoyle bag candied orange slices. Ilya then agonized over the question - what to give the principal, which helped him out so much, and found nothing better, recalling the love of his silver-bearded grandfather to lemon slices. Yes, the professor was very eccentric.   The boy struggled with himself for a while, but being unable to hold back, he grabbed his textbook and typewriter and rushed to the bedroom. There he quickly threw on his leaky clothes, slightly patched up with household charms, and slung the bag on his shoulder. Into it he left some parchment scrolls, put the same jar wrapped in duct tape and a shredded quill, then carefully stowed all his textbooks and the headmaster's gift. After that, dignifying the mantle with a contemptuous snort, the boy ran out into the corridor. Ilya never wore those stupid cloaks, mistakenly called robes, on weekends, and putting on that ugly thing on vacation... that was out of the question.   Holding his bag, the boy wandered through the corridors, hurrying to get to "his" class number "22". On the way he managed to bump into, if I may say so in this case, Almost Headless Nick. This, a bit reckless, ghost on the one hand upset when pointed out to him his shortcoming - not completely beheaded, and on the other, always ready to demonstrate this same flaw. However, Ilya communicated with ghosts very little, they avoided him, and the lad himself kept away from these floating, transparent substance. Only approaching the clots of ectoplasm boy began to feel the same feelings as when he met with a troll and in Potions class, except they were not as sharp. So the boy only saw ghosts from a distance, and when they spotted the boy, they hurried away. And now, flew out from behind the turn Nick for a while staring shocked at Ilya, and then, without a word, disappeared into a nearby wall. In a word, a boor.   The boy turned behind the fifth knight's armor, passed the tapestry behind which was an alcove for kissing and more, and stopped in front of the classroom door. He leisurely pulled the knob toward him and stepped forward. In front of him was a spacious room of an ordinary school classroom. He had not noticed the cupboard in the far corner of the room until Flitwick had pointed out that it contained old robes, and he would never have noticed it. By now the Master of Witchcraft had put it away. He must have moved it to another room, you little invader.   Ilya flopped down on his desk. Though, that would be a silly thing to call it that-just two desks slid together to form a wide desk. The student pulled out his textbooks, a stack of parchment sheets, and his workbook, ordered from Florish and Bolts. Clad in a beautiful red cover with interesting ornamentation, the notebook was naturally magical. For example, one could write in it ad infinitum. As soon as you ran out of space, you needed to whisper the magic formula described in the book, and voila, the notebook was clean. But don't think about it, it wasn't some cheap scam, the notes weren't lost anywhere, they were kept in... well, the boy didn't know where, but they were definitely kept somewhere. He whispered another formula, and the table of contents would appear on the first page: just tap on the name with the wand and the desired section would open. So "Wizard's Diary, model v14.2" was worth its money - one galleon, four skils, and seven knats.   Opening his notes, the boy whispered "Videtius," and then selected the Animagia section. It was still empty, but the boy had high hopes for the gift. Putting the diary aside, the young man carefully opened the textbook. For some reason, on the first page, in sloppy handwriting was printed "Property of Sohatogo, Vagabond, Lunatic and Tail." For some reason the boy thought he had seen this inscription somewhere before, but dismissed the suspicion as not worthy of attention. So, it was time to get closer to the dream.   Evening of the same day - same place.    - I fucking... - the boy looked around, and decided that the castle had ears, too, and so there was no need to finish the swearing.   He had a notebook in front of him, scrawled with excerpts from the textbook and filled with various calculations. The first chapter stated that Animagia, contrary to popular belief, did not depend so much on the wizard's talent and strength as on the lack of laziness, desire, and patience. If you don't waste time, you can learn the science of transformation into a totem beast in a year, if you are a total dummy in Transfiguration - in two or two and a half at the most. And the rituals required for that branch of magic require only a rudimentary understanding of the transmutation of living creatures, which all Hog sophomores have to pass in the first few months. So the author, Dux Lupus, wrote that the stereotypes that have taken root in the magical environment regarding Animagy are a consequence of widespread laziness and a desire to snatch everything at once.   The introduction was followed by the most important chapter, pardon the tophthology. There were formulas for calculating one's animagic form, and a remark about how it was impossible to become a magical creature, so if that's why the magician opened the book, then let him close it and go to the nearest bar, rent a whore, and take comfort in her breasts... (The author was a bit of a freak). Anyway, the guy wasted no time in doing the math. After almost six years of math and half a year of Numerology, and even with a counting machine, it wasn't much of a problem. The problem was self-measurement, but that was where a small ruler mirror and a levitation charm came in handy. Flitwick was right when he said they could help him on his journey through life. The measurements themselves took a long four hours. Translate into inches and feet needed absolutely everything - from height and to the length of the left pinky to the right foot, from the length of the nose and to the size of the reproductive organ (if novice Animagus - male). The kid was never ashamed of his size of a certain organ, and there was nothing to be ashamed of, rather he was proud of it. So back in the classroom after lunch, Ilya began to calculate.   Clicking the calculator, and writing long rows of numbers, the boy dreamed of his future form. Of course, he hoped that like his idol, Ilya, he would turn into a falcon and soar free in the sky. But he wouldn't mind turning into a beautiful, noble white wolf, a proud tiger, a fierce grizzly, or a jaguar that was called 'one kick kill', and maybe an eagle, or a snow leopard, and the wolf-cub also not a bad option. An Andalusian stallion is also excellent, and maybe a deer with huge antlers (silly sounding of course, still like an insult), well, a leopard, as well as another thousand and one animals that came to mind the boy would be the top of his dreams. But now the calculations were done, the dextki, the hundreds, almost a thousand times the answer was checked, and the result was just as unchanged as the midwife's verdict.   Chief White Feather, the pale-faced leader of the defunct Power Mongoose organization, handsome, darling, good-looking, a fellow in his own right, a first-year student, an orphan at St. Frederick's. A resident of Scary Square, the leader of the youngest gang, weasel and rascal, future Master Char, winner of the "Weekly War with the Devil Slugs", Night Flyer, cursed by Filch, Hooch and Norris (at least not by Chuck), best Hogwarts safecracker, beloved by audience - Garbert Ilya, will transform into... ...a cat! Yes, yes. Not into some ferocious predator, or a frisky bird, not into a noble beast, but into a bloody cat, chewed up by Mordered, spat on by Morgana and trampled on by Merlin - a cat! Devil, the lad was sure that if his animagic form ever, ever found out about the female population of the castle, the former squeeze would seem like a Slytherin table exclusion zone paradise to him.   Yes, you got that right, Ilya wasn't going to give up what he started. After all, Animagi got their preferential treatment from their own uniforms. The boy had already seen the dexterity and grace with which the Yellow Lady wielded her wand, so he consoled himself that he too would get his bonuses from such a difficult task. With a heavy sigh, the hapless Andalusian stallion, jaguar, wolf, and so on and so forth, turned the page and opened the second chapter, reading through the first ritual. The first ritual required transmutation of the fingernail of the little finger of the left hand. It was advised to do it forty-seven times, minimum - forty-six, for the lazy, so to say. In Ilya's case, the fingernail had to become a claw. And therefore... hence the need to go to the library for a Transfiguration textbook for the second year and begin a new plunge into the hell of the hated science. But what can't you do to learn how to turn into a... a cat.   - Kill me," Ilya whispered, heading for Madame Pince's abode.   January 1, 1992 Hogwarts, abode of evil and despair, forgotten by god, Merlin and the devil, class "22"       Once again, with a wave of his wand, he tried to turn the white mouse stolen from McGonagall's office into a rat, but it was still sitting in its cage, chewing cheese peacefully. Tailed asshole. It was Ilya's cheese, but the rodent didn't want to sit still, dodging the kid's spells. Putting petrificus was not an option, it could interfere with transmutation spells. So she had to share the munchies. So she sits there, sharpening, while the boy's stomach rumbles. In fact, it was hard to imagine how much effort he was putting into learning how to turn fluffy. For starters, it turns out that sophomores go through transmutation of living to non-living and living to non-living. But living to living is a third-year topic. And what would you think - Ilya shrugged and went to change the textbook. And what was his surprise when before his eyes was a scheme of wand movements, which required drawing as much as three patterns, and a formula of two devious Latin words with tongue-twisting pronunciation. From dusk till dawn, for five days now, wasting time only for five hours of sleep, food and toilets, the boy had been struggling with the spell. It was hard to imagine how much man-fuel had been expended in those hours.   And swinging again, this time for the multimillionth time, the mouse froze, then squeaked and with a light pop, turned into... into a mouse rat. Stunned by such a spectacle, the boy quickly cancelled the spell, and then jumped around the classroom, waving his arms in joy. Ilya even jumped on the desk tried to dance an Irish jig, but almost toppled over in the cold, so that the dance had to wait. Told the mouse to be obedient and not to try to pick the lock, the boy put away his things, being especially careful with his textbooks, notebooks and a typewriter. The first and third were gifts, and the second had been bought with blood money he'd won at poker. In general, magicians were terrible at this game, on their faces you could literally read the combinations that they fell out. In general, no wonder that after two months, no senior dared to dare to play Texas Hold'em with Ilya, and he was satisfied with the five galennies won during this time.   Closing the classroom door behind him, the boy, whistling the light melody of "Three little birds," made his way to Flitwick's office, where a nearly repaired guitar was waiting for him. All that remained was to adjust the picks and strings. By the way, the strings had been bought by the professor, they were magical and sort of super cool, the boy was grateful. Oh, and the master of spells left the key to the office for his student, the boy at first was taken aback by such a trust, and then hung the key by a homemade leather string around his neck, keeping the metal kid as the apple of his eye. Ilya did not even suspect that in this way, the old and very cunning professor was trying to teach the tomboy responsibility...       January 2, 1992. Hovagrents   The boy reached out, pulling back the warm blanket. A new day and new happiness. Outside the window, large snow flakes whirled in a bizarre dance. The visible forest covered with a white blanket seemed to fall asleep and did not share the boy's joy at all. And there was a lot to rejoice about. Last night Ilya managed to play the guitar, but he was so sleepy that he could not play a couple of chords and had to go to sleep.   And now, when a black acoustic guitar stood on the right side, propped against the wall, shining with green and scarlet streaks in the rays of the winter sun. With books and a counting typewriter on the nightstand on the left side, and no aristocrats in the bedroom or even the whole living room, the kid knew it couldn't get any better than this. Quickly dressing, throwing on his shabby, even worn clothes, the boy stowed his guitar in its case and squeezed his hands into the straps and stood up. A bag on his left shoulder followed him, though Ilya reasonably thought that he wouldn't need anything but his six stringed baby today and tomorrow, and maybe even after that.    He ran to the door of the room, unable to wipe the smile off his face, he glanced happily at the window covered in an intricate pattern of frost, and then slipped away. Within a few minutes, he was hurtling down the hall, ignoring the doors to the Great Hall, no time for food. You must agree, for Ilya, neglecting to eat meant only two things - the young wizard was crazy, or something archival was on his mind.   Swiftly ascending the marble stairs leading to the first floor, the boy turned down the corridor and came out to the main well. If you looked up, you could see dozens of staircases moving in a completely chaotic fashion. Ilya slowed his step, sucking in air and began to move cautiously upwards. He chose the shortest route, since up to the hidden stairs, it would be necessary to make a detour. But, as it usually happens, the shortest way is always the most difficult. The seventh step suddenly flickered and disappeared, right under his foot. He jumped over it briskly and immediately grabbed the handrail. The stairs began to move and, from the looks of it, were going to lead the wizard not to where he was supposed to. Ilya, grabbing his bag, sprawled and jumped, landing happily on top of another wooden ladder. The same did not wait long and followed his friend, another run, another jump, and now Ilya is on the second floor.   Ilya turned a hundred and eighty and watched the two boorish girls go back to their seats, pretending not to mock the unfortunate Slytherin. Putting a thumb to his left nostril, the boy snorted loudly with his right, showing maximum disdain for the disembodied attempts to lead him astray. Then five smiled and raced down the corridor. Alas, he was not destined to make it properly to the office. Straight ahead were Potter and Ginger, coming down from their tower in a hurry for breakfast. When they leveled with Ilya, they glanced over and Weasley shrugged, but Harry only flashed his eyes resolutely.   - Ilya," Potter said, a little shyly, in his usual manner.   - Huh? - The boy stopped, though he didn't stop moving, continuing to run in place. The Gryffiondrons were a little dazed. - Harry, let's pick up the pace.   - Um, do you know who Nicholas Flamel is?   - Pfft. Of course I know. We drank vodka together yesterday.   The people didn't appreciate the joke, they didn't even understand it, but they did roll their eyes.   - Oh," Ilya sighed. - It was a joke," I said in humor. "Well, Flamel is a reputable alchemist. He was famous for inventing the Philosopher's Stone in some beardy year.   - The Philosopher's Stone? - Weasley interjected.   - Yeah. It's a gimmick. He was a bit like that, but he had a lot of time to think about it, so he was a bit like the rest of us.   The reds looked at each other, and there was a look of consternation in their eyes. Ilya wondered what that was about, but then decided that he didn't need the secrets of others.   - Thanks for your help," Potter nodded.   - No problem," Ilya brushed him off. - If there's anything else, you're welcome to contact me. Ilya's information desk is open Monday through Friday, no appointment necessary.   With these words the boy rushed down the corridor, but then he stopped. There was one problem that began to gnaw at him at times. Sometimes having a big, kind heart meant having to worry about a lot of fluff. But still, it was worth it to calm his guilty conscience.   - Hey, little fellows! - Ilya called out to the Gryffindors, who were almost out of sight.   - What?" Weasley muttered, and Potter frowned as well. Apparently they thought the Slytherin was going to sing about returning the favor, as payment for the information. And they were damn right.   - You guys are texting with Danger, right?   - With who?   - Yeah, with your Granger.   - Well, yes," Harry the Steel Eggs-Potter answered a little uncertainly.   - Well, then you tell her that I apologize for Cipollino, and I apologize for my rudeness. You can write that I promise to mend my ways and behave in a righteous way, but it won't be true.   - Why the sudden happiness of an apology from a Slytherin? - Weasley chuckled, crossing his arms over his chest.   - Ron!" Potter snapped at his friend. - Okay, we'll pass it on.   - I always knew you were a nice guy," Ilya nodded. - I've always known you were a normal guy," Ilya nodded. I'll be back.   With these words Ilya took a sprint and a moment later disappeared around the corner. There he passed the beloved tapestry, depicting some epic battle of those same goblins. Goblins are maniacs. They smell blood when they see it, they know where my sword and axe are. Truth is not clear why they are forbidden to carry wands, if these eternal bankers can not a shit use magic, except perhaps strictly on their own. But goblins, for example, can make a bewitching, centaurs dart with bows without a miss, and stars communicate with stars, and goblins, as though everything they can make out of metal, even spherical horse in vacuum. He was a little pissed off, but I was a little pissed off.   Finally the kid was in his classroom and sighed in relief as he closed the door behind him. The white mouse was still in its cage, and there was no more cheese. It had gobbled it all up, or rather, washed it all away. But nothing, Ilya was a hoarder, so he took out from the bag one more piece of milk product, threw it to the mouse, which immediately began to grind it. The voracious beast. I can't believe McGonagall didn't go broke on those.   Gently taking the guitar out of its case, the boy sat cross-legged on the desk and plucked the strings, tweaking the picks and enjoying the even improved sound. The boy bobbed a little, improvising on just two chords, then shook his head softly. Something was missing...   - Oh!" the boy exclaimed and reached for the mouse cage, setting it right in front of him. - You'll be my listener.   Then the boy closed his eyes and began to play, enjoying every note, every semitone, every sound produced by his old friend, with whom they had been through fire and water together, and now glue as well. The boy played non-stop, ignoring the aching pain in his fingertips that had softened after a month and a half. He played sometimes cheerful, joyful songs, and then switched to sad and even sorrowful ones, but only to give birth to a joyful melody, serene and full of sincere, childish joy, after a couple of minutes again, briskly plucking the strings.   The boy was so engrossed in playing and his guitar that he did not notice that a huge, tall mirror had appeared by the far wall. On it was an old, frayed inscription - "Einalezh eonnevorkos eshavon otsil esha ven yuavizakopia", it read. However, even if the boy had noticed it now, he would not have approached it, as at the moment, there was nothing for him but music and a mouse, which had frozen, having dropped a piece of cheese from its paws, and was attentively listening to the boy's play. And any casual bystander, carelessly entering this room, would have been unable to control himself and would have sat down on any horizontal plane, enjoying the slightly otherworldly, mesmerizing music. But no one ever went in, and never came close to another mystery and paradox of magic that, so far, not even the owner of this secret was aware of. And only one object in the whole castle, singing only once a year, knew, as always, the answers to all questions. But this same object, lying in the principal's office, listened to the music emerging from under the boy's flickering fingers in a wild dance. You might ask how on earth he could have heard that tune through the thick masonry walls and several floors. Well, it seems we've discovered another, rather amusing paradox. Perhaps Ollivander would be pleased.   * * *   The boy got so carried away that the music stopped only when the pain became almost unbearable. Ilya woke up, strayed from the note and made a crooked sound, and set the guitar aside carefully. The fingertips of his left hand were bleeding and searing. The boy wiped them on a not very clean handkerchief and then looked at his broken plectrum with astonishment. How could he play with it? He had a dozen more in his trunk. Carefully he put his guitar in a case, thanked the mouse for agreeing to listen to him and was ready to go to the living room. But it was the deep night in the castle: moon was shining behind the cows and stars were twinkling, sometimes peeking out from behind the clouds. So Ilya decided that he should hurry, lest he fall into the clutches of the uncompromising old scribbler Filch.   The boy threw the case behind his back and was already picking up his bag when he looked at a huge mirror standing by the north wall. It had not been there before, that is, just yesterday, and that alarmed the boy. As if an animal, he felt as if someone had entered his den, his lair, without asking him, and began to take charge of it. The boy felt uncomfortable, as if he had lost the right to "own" the class number "22", and now it was no longer his refuge. Still, curiosity overcame dislike.   Ilya easily jumped off the desk and quickly approached the mirror. He read the inscription carefully and at first thought there was something wrong with it, but then he looked inside and saw there - himself. A handsome, tall boy, with a trim figure, kind, bright blue eyes and dark whites, high cheekbones, black, resinous hair, which had grown decently and now covered his forehead. We should go to Madame Pomfrey, she acts as a hairdresser for the younger ones, and the older ones visit the warriors of scissors and combs in Hogsmeade. There's even a beauty salon for girls, and an inn, where you can rent a room... In general, Ilya twisted, guessing what things he had better quickly replace. As it turned out - jeans suffered most of all. From jeans was not much left, one big patch, and the colorful. The boy worked on his "muzzle" for a while, coming to the conclusion that progress is evident, as he himself had almost fallen under his own spell. Then came a turn for a couple of smiles that drove the girls into a blush, and the crown wink, except that it did not deprive the opposite sex of feelings. The usual gestures ended, and the boy was especially good at the macaque.   - Pity I forgot the banana," the boy almost smashed the mirror with his forehead, but he was caught in time by someone's charms.   The boy turned around and saw that Dumbledore was sitting at the next desk, literally disarming with his spontaneity. The headmaster was in good spirits as usual, smiling into his long beard and munching on another sweet.   - May I ask, my boy, what did you see there that you decided to play the monkey.   The magic grandfather's eyes twinkled familiarly, and the half-glasses reflected the light of the full moon. It was like Gandalf, except instead of a staff, it was a curious-looking wand.   - Uh," the boy said. - Himself, Professor.   - Yourself? - Dumbledore seemed surprised, astonished even.   - Well. I don't know much about magic, of course," Ilya stretched out. - But was I supposed to see someone else in the mirror.   - Perhaps... Ilya, did you read the inscription?   - Yeah, but I was too lazy to take it apart.   - And you try," the director winked slyly, popping an orange slice into his mouth. And a second later, with the other hand, a lemon one. Apparently he couldn't make up his mind.   The boy turned his face to the mirror again, lifted his head and looked closely. It was quite simple. All he had to do was read the text backwards.   - I'm not showing your face, but your innermost desire," the boy said, and then panicked. - Professor! I didn't even touch it! Honestly, I didn't break that artifact!   Dumbledore froze, then laughed his slightly hoarse, aged laugh.   - Oh, Ilya, you're just like that," Grandfather said, wiping away his tears and wiping his glasses with the corner of his robe. - I think the mirror is all right, for I can still see myself and my woollen socks in it. As for you, well, I think I'm glad you're happy.   - Happy? - the boy interjected.   - Yes, happy," the headmaster nodded. - This mirror looks into the soul of the beholder, and draws out his most secret, fervent and innermost desires. But, a happy man, looking into it, will see nothing but himself.   The boy nodded and turned to the mirror. He stared at his own reflection for a long time, and then began to rub his chin thoroughly. This was always the way when Ilya took up brainstorming. And in his brainstorming the boy used the tactic - "truth in madness". That is, if you find the most idiotic theory, you should think about it for as long as possible and eventually you will find the right answer.   - I don't agree," the boy finally said.   - And what is your point of view? - The headmaster asked softly, stroking the mouse that had fallen asleep in his palm.   - It seems to me that the mirror does not show desire in several cases, for example - if one does not know what to show. So, if a person passionately desires not one thing, but several things.   - Very interesting," said the headmaster. - I couldn't agree with you more, but go on.   - Also, if a person desires something metaphysical or metaphorical, such as happiness in the whole world, then the mirror will also reflect only his image. There is a third variant, if a person doesn't know what to wish, which is a reference to the first variant, because in this case all wishes are of equal value.   There was silence in the classroom for a while. The headmaster put the asleep mouse into the cage and closed the door carefully.   - I think, listening to you, Lady Rowena would bite her elbows to see the green crest on your chest," Dumbledore glinted. - And yet, I don't think you'd deny that a happy man, too, would only see himself that way.   - Yeah, I won't.   - The question then becomes, do you want to consider yourself happy?   - Uh, excuse me, Professor, I'm not really clear on...   - Oh, that's all right, boy, that's all right, I'll explain. You see, you are now standing at a kind of fork in the road. On your left, you have your logic, wit and discernment, and on your right, all that defies reason. So, going one way, you will accept the fact that you have several equal desires or one metaphysical or metaphorical desire. And going the other way, you may well consider yourself a happy person.   The boy pondered, the seemingly simple conclusion was so profound and complex that thinking about it made his head hurt.   - You mean," the boy said in a measured, almost syllabic tone. - It's all up to me and my choices again, isn't it?   - Of course, Ilya!" exclaimed the headmaster. - Everything in magic always depends on the magician himself and his choices.   - Then there's a lot I don't understand," the boy exhaled. - At least the division into different branches of Dark and Light magic, too. Because if everything depends on the mage's choice and himself, then that, and a lot of other things, are complete nonsense.   - Again, you're absolutely right. But you see, here's the thing. Paradoxes of magic, that's what they are for, so that a man doesn't forget about the choice.   - And even in this saying of yours, there is a paradox - choice gives birth to a paradox that helps us remember the choice.   Dumbledore only smiled, popping two slices into his mouth at once. For half a year he had hardly seen or spoken to this child, and it seemed as if only yesterday they had had a similarly entertaining dialogue in the Fortescue Caf. But something was keeping the director busy. A moment later his gaze grew heavy, and his smile faded on his lips.   - By the way, my boy, how's your research coming? Should I be preparing a tip for the waitress at the cafe yet?   - A tip? - He asked the boy again, and then it hit him. Cold sweat ran down his back, and he was a little embarrassed. - Professor, here's the thing...   - Yes, my boy? - Dumbledore nudged the answer in a slightly concerned tone.   - No way.   - Nothing? - Albus almost choked on his slices.   - Yes," the boy exhaled sadly. - There's so much going on, and so much to see. Well, it makes this whole three-way thing with the Dark Lord seem so dull and pointless. He's dead.   Dumbledore stared at the boy carefully for a while, then smiled quite happily.   - Once again you amaze me Ilya! I am more and more convinced that I met a wizard with a good heart and an open soul in the orphanage, in the midst of much sadness.   - I'm afraid," the boy shook his head sadly. - I'm not as kind as you think I am. Anyway, I've done a lot of things in the past month that certainly don't fit the term.   - And these words only confirm my assertion! - The headmaster almost clapped his hands, and then somehow slyly twinkled his old, but somewhat childlike, eyes. - Ilya, it's midnight already, and I saw a slightly distressed Mr. Filch walking around the first floor.   The boy was scalded, nodding quickly and grabbing his things along with the mouse cage.   - Good night, Professor! - with these words, the lad slipped out into the corridor like a lazy cat.   The ancient sorcerer sat in the classroom chewing on the slices for a while longer, and then suddenly vanished, as if he hadn't existed.   January 6, 1992 Hogwarts       Ilya, with the case on his back, the bag on his shoulder, and the mouse cage in his hands, sat on the sixth floor, right on the floor, and sighed heavily. Tomorrow the students would arrive, and he still hadn't found a new home. Class number "22" could no longer be used, as the shelter had lost its shelter status. The boy had been living in Flitwick's study for a couple of days, but it was Flitwick's study, and the boy couldn't hang around there forever and certainly not show up there after curfew. So he had to find a new den. Last time, the choice fell on the twenty-second because it never went there at night the elders. At first Ilya couldn't understand why, but then the Master of Spells explained it with mantles. And now, the boy had an impossible task, to find another place where he would not be caught unawares wishing privacy or fun, older guys. To this end, temporarily homeless student, literally all over Hogwarts, from the dungeons and to the Astronomy Tower, but could not find a class that would not have heard some witty or humorous story. Over the centuries of study, the students seemed to have found all the hidden places that only this place had. So, Ilya, sank into an acute fit of melancholy, talking to the mouse, lamenting his horrible and unfair life as a man deprived of a shelter.   - Mr. Ilya," a distant voice rumbled as if echoing.   The boy, feeling a rush of disgust and squeamishness, raised his head, meeting his gaze with the Bloody Baron, the ghost of Slytherin. In fact the Baron, the ancient knight, who still hung on his belt, was not only the patron saint of the Greens but also the head of all the ghosts of Hogwarts. So far the boy had only heard of him, but had never seen him.   - I'm listening to you carefully," Ilya squeaked, restraining the urge to get away from the ghost immediately.   The Baron, when he was alive, was a tall man with broad shoulders, a massive forehead, broad cheekbones, and a belligerent face. In fact, he remained that way after his death, and his gaze had not grown any lighter in hundreds of years, still capable of literally nailing him to the floor.   - It has come to my attention, Mr. Ilya, that you are looking for a new abode. I have taken it upon myself to assist you in this enterprise.   - Need any help? - Ilya snickered evilly. - Even though I'm a filthy filthy girl?   - Even so," the Baron hissed through gritted teeth, clutching the hilt of his blade in his right hand. If he'd been alive, his knuckles would have turned white and his face would have rippled. - Even considering, Mr. Ilya, that you're far more abominable than your average filthy counterpart. But that doesn't take away from the fact that Slytherin has done damage to you, when you have done much for the glory of your faculty. I consider it my duty to wash away that stain of shame. You will find your new abode on the seventh floor, opposite the portrait of Barnabas the Grumpy. Walk three times past the wall opposite the portrait, mentally imagining and describing the room you need. I said.   And immediately Baron flew into the wall, leaving behind only an echo of disgust and a fit of nausea.   - Nasty-looking," Ilya snickered.   Of course, a mudblood with the Slytherin crest on it was far worse than a regular mudblood. However, the boy, though he didn't believe the ghost, since he remembered that there was only a wall opposite the image of the madman trying to teach the trolls how to dance, still got up off his ass and decided to walk around. After all, he had nothing to lose, and hope dies last, in case there really was some special hiding place.   Shaking off his tattered trousers, the boy headed for the ladders. Today they were surprisingly respectful and stood still, afraid to move. The boy easily made it to the seventh floor, which contained two large rooms (one used to teach dancing and the other fencing), a few offices and that was about it. Reaching the right picture, which habitually caused only a smile, the boy turned around and looked. It looked like a wall, a wall to the touch. Not a hint of a door or anything like that, though...   "I need a gym where I can find everything to exercise in. I need a gym where I can find everything to do. I need a gym where I can find everything to do."   The boy did three laps back and forth, then stopped and watched with dropped jaw as a door loomed in the wall. A real, oak, heavy, iron-striped door. It was as if it had become three dimensional, and, with a loud click, a cast-iron handle jutted forward. The boy, with a frozen heart, jerked it toward him and squeezed his eyes shut because of the bright light that struck his eyes. When he could see again, he could not contain a cry of delight.   - I'm in heaven... Chapter 7.   (p.a. leave a comment, anyone reading this. Spend two minutes of your time throwing a slipper or "thank you" to the author.)   January 16, 1992, Hogwarts, Headquarters of the defunct Power Mongoose.   On the floor sat a tall boy with a black bandana on his head, wearing a gray shirt with the sleeves rolled up over his shoulders, and denim breeches of all sorts. He was holding a spanner in his hand, which he was now wielding as he struggled to fix the leg of the training complex. He was quite good at it, in any case, once the puck was in place, there was no more risk that the multi-kilogram structure would collapse during the training, burying the boy under it.    Ilya put the key in a chest with many compartments, where there were already: a small axe, a hammer, different screws, bolts, screws, nuts, dowels, one core (a bit lame, it could even be used instead of a chisel) and many more different tools and materials. You ask: where did the kid get it all? Well, Mr. Filch has been wondering for a week where it all went. It seems that if we can get you together with the janitor, you'll be able to uncover this terrible mystery...   Ilya exhaled, pulled his shirt over his head, and leaned his heated body against the cold iron. During this week he had time to work on his headquarters, and to find out a lot about it. Probably the first time he entered this strange room, he really thought he was in his own private paradise. It was a huge, spacious, bright room that would have fit even two of Flitwick's offices. On its east side was... A ring, really, a ring from the turn of this century, with wadded uprights and rubberized ropes that replaced the elastic ropes. Ropes had sagged long ago and some were even torn. Next to the ring there was a Swedish wall with long ago frayed paint, broken steps and skewed chin-ups, beaten by rust. Farther away there were various weight machines that fell apart just by the pressure of boy's glance, and it was not even necessary to breathe on them. And, of course, the floor in this area was lined with crumpled, leaky mattresses.    On the west side, however, was an oak table with twisted legs, large cracks, and broken drawers. The surface of the table was cracked, the once green, now marshy, cloth, and the lamp looked like a pre-revolutionary version of a lampstand (the English Bourgeois Revolution, at the end of 1688, was meant). To the side of the desk were some storage cupboards with broken glass and warped doors, inside which were some appliances which could not be identified but evidently were in need of a thorough overhaul. The only thing they were able to identify was a deformed pest-scope, which looked more like a light bulb from a Nazi bunker. Behind the cabinets there were shelves, in rows, and they were in perfect condition, as well as books standing on them. By the way, it was this nuance that gave the boy a certain thought, but about this later. In the center in the far recess there were some wooden dummies with targets on the chest. They were set in motion by a broken mechanism, which was missing a pair of gears, and the lever itself was broken in the area of the handle.    Everything the boy's eye could see required a thorough repair, and, of course, Ilya's active nature could not sit still on its ass. That same night Filch's storeroom was broken into, and a lot of tools and materials were taken out of it and used for repairs (thanks to Flitwick for the bag). The next night, after a feast to celebrate the arrival of the students, the same fate befell Madame Pomfrey, who lost all her supplies of cotton wool, rubber bands, gauze, brocade, and other cloth. A day later, Hagrid felt a distinct lack of wood, and not only had the price not been reduced, but it had been slammed down to one and a half times the price - the monopolists.    In the same way, in some miraculous way, in each living room either a armchair or a sofa was missing. The house elves complained that benches disappeared in the castle, or rather, from them remain only splinters, and the main material is dragged away by someone. In general, people sin on the fact that in the castle started up some new spirit or poltergeist, which decided to reduce the number of movable property. The Ghostbusters were even questioned, as there were hundreds of them, but the ectoplasmic ones shook their heads and denied the existence of any new lodger. Only the Bloody Baron repeatedly spoke in vague riddles, referring to Barnabas the Grumpy. In principle, this had some effect. So, a team of headmen, led by the Iron Lady and Sallow-Haired, spent the entire night patrolling the seventh floor, but found nothing. By the twelfth of January the thefts had ceased and the castle breathed freely, no one feared that it too would be put on a spear for the purpose of "grabbing" any property. And in the meantime, while the Bloody Baron was baiting his riddles, Flitwick was smiling a little predatorily, Dumbledore was doing research on an orange-lemon hybrid, work was boiling at the Power of Mongoose headquarters.    The first thing Ilya did was to take up the ring. He stuffed the uprights with cotton wool, covering the "wounds" with the help of learned household charms. Then he replaced rubberized ropes with enlarged rubber bands, well, and laid the floor with new planks, built a kind of sandy mat on top of them. After that came a turn of the Swedish wall and horizontal bars, further - a table and a cupboard, the glass for which had been pressed in greenhouses, well, and the most monotonous and difficult work - repairing of the starting mechanism of mannequins and repair of power complexes. The guy spent a week on the job, a couple of hammered fingers, several bandages, which wrapped up the areas where the kid had cut the flesh with a saw (carelessly, of course), two shirts, torn to pieces and beyond repair, about a hundred liters of water for indoor use and twice as much - for outdoor, and much, much more. But the result was worth it - the den looked like Batman's cave, only in its magical variation.   The finishing touch remained. The boy took a wide sheet of cotton paper and, using red paint, wrote in big letters - "Property of Ilya the Pruny". Then he hung this creation right above the entrance - on the inside, of course, securing it with the charms of eternal sticking. But we seem to have forgotten about the boy's idea. Ilya was a little amazed that among such devastation the racks of books, which, in theory, should have suffered first, had survived. And the way of opening the HQ in no way resembled any kind of locking spell that responds to the password - as, say, in the common baths, baths, well, and in the living room. So on the very first night, the kid went out into the hallway, waited for the door to disappear, and then wished for the restroom. Voila, we have a toilet that painfully resembles a third floor toilet. This prompted the kid, and he wished for the fourth, then the fifth and sixth toilets, and got them all as they were at the moment. Then Ilya wished for the toilet, which he had visited more than once at St. Frederick's asylum, and got nothing, the door never appeared. Another series of experiments followed, which helped the lad to appreciate the full extent of the magic of that room.    As it turned out, his headquarters could take dimensions from a broom closet to the Great Hall, but no less and no more than those limits. In the same way, you couldn't materialize a forest in a room, but you could materialize a greenhouse, you couldn't materialize a pond, but you could materialize a puddle intentionally spilled by the door, and so on and so forth. In general, a room could create an exact material copy of anything in the castle. But the object had to be: firstly inanimate, secondly non-magical, as magic was not copied by the HQ, well, and it was also impossible to summon food here, but that was one of the fundamental laws of transfiguration at all. So it turns out that not all places at Hogwarts had been explored. Since during his wandering, Ilya never found a classroom with a ring, or a room with mannequins, and certainly did not see any Muggle trainers or Swedish walls. Someday, however, he would surely find them. As for the books and shelving, naturally they had been copied directly from the Library. There was no restriction on the Forbidden Section, except that most of the works in that section possessed their own magic, so they could not be transferred to the HQ. And the boy himself did not need them: everything he needed he already had. Thus, by January 16, Ilya had acquired his own abode, to put it in the language of the long dead knight.    Ilya got up and moved from the simulator to the seating area, which he was furnishing himself. Around the fireplace, an exact copy of Gryffindor's (the biggest and most beautiful one they had), were two armchairs for one person and two sofas for three, and there was a glass table right in front of them. The kid liked to sit there and look through a book. The most amazing thing was that as long as he was in his headquarters, even the housekeepers could not find him, and the door of the headquarters also disappeared, turning into a wall. So it really was a super-hero cave in which to hide from everyone. A real man's den. Except for the lack of socks scattered everywhere, empty pizza boxes, jingling bottles in the corner and hanging in the closets underwear, but this is a gain. The only frustrating thing for the boy was that it was impossible to materialize a shower here, apparently HQ had no access to the common sewer pipes, which was depressing. Speaking of which, I mean showers - lately the kid's been on to Animagia, you may have even guessed why. After all, as a cat, it's so easy to sneak into common women's showers... But these are all dreams, and for now, Ilya is having a hard time transforming his fingernail into a claw. In the meantime, he has transformed his fingernail into a claw. True, at the same time, feeling a slight prick of sadness, now he will not have a listener. No, playing for himself is also very cool and exciting, but playing for an audience has its own charm and even some slight, intangible, but still magic.    With these not very positive thoughts, he threw on his sweat-stained shirt and left his den. He went out into the corridor, watched the door disappear into the wall for a while, and then headed towards the dungeons. As usual, there were a few surprises waiting for him on the stairs, but the seasoned lad was used to Hog's predicament, so he reached the snakes' domain without much difficulty. Today, Sunday night, it wasn't particularly lively, and the castle seemed asleep in anticipation of Friday and Saturday, when students would put their textbooks aside and arm themselves with something else.    - Glory be to Rod," the boy said, and the wall blocking access to the living room went transparent.   Ilya silently hated all those passwords: it was as if some pompous royal valet had invented them. Or an elder house elf of the same Malfoys. The passwords were too pretentious and garish, "Purity of Blood" alone.   Almost the entire faculty was packed into the living room, as usual. By the fireplace, on the trump chairs and sofas, sat the seniors in the arms of their girlfriends, as well as Draco and his gang (Daddy's authority figures). Juniors panting in the study area, quills scribbling against parchment. Among the workers, Ilya spotted Daphne and Blaze. Holding back a furtive chuckle, the boy walked past, but was spotted nonetheless. Greengrass was about to open his mouth, but he was grabbed by the arm of some fourth year girl and shook his head. The blonde beauty audibly gritted her teeth and, flashing her blue eyes, returned to her abstract. Having the status of untouchable was still pretty damn convenient. Ilya strolled down the corridor, and when he reached the freshman dormitory, more out of habit than real need, he pulled out his wand, preparing to repel some mischief. However, when he opened the door, Illyaetak didn't have to use his weak protective charms, which even Longbottom would have broken through with a crooked Petrificus.    From the chest, the boy took out a large terry towel that clearly needed replacing, a washcloth that was already stripping the skin off, not just the dirt and sweat, and the rest of the soapy stuff. Putting it all away in a bag and then shoving it into his bag, the boy left the bedroom and then the living room, catching glances full of powerless anger. Ilya's path lay on the fourth floor, where the common showers were located. Actually, each department had their own, but they had only three cabins and the line stretched a lot. At Slytherins and at all hung a schedule, what course and when, and the guys for some reason were given the most inconvenient hours. In fact, Ilya wasn't stupid enough to risk showering with his dearest comrades-in-arms. Who knew those aristocrats... However, in order to go to a common bath, in which there were about a dozen cabins and even had a small pool, so was a significant disadvantage. One day, in the early months of his studies, the guy woke up because of a nightmare, and out of habit, not even thinking about it, went to the shower, in order to rinse and go back to his room. Ilya then grabbed some soapy things, and, not realizing that he was in Hog and Filch wasn't napping, openly stumbled to the fourth floor. Apparently, such insolence made fate itself cringe, and the lad made it without any trouble. Devil, he'd better have. That ill-fated night, the lad opened the door and, oh Merlin, saw some seventh year from Gryffindor, who was busy... ...a seventh-year Hufflepuff student. Sleep was relieved. It only took a second for the boy to slam the door and then, running to some alcove, vomit out whatever he could vomit out at four in the morning. After this incident, the boy did not wash for about six days, but still he had to remember personal hygiene. Since then, Ilya began to enter the common shower room with a wand at the ready and with the spell "Incendio" on his mind. Well, besides, Ilya now bypassed a mile around Malfoy, he thought that the dirty blonde is afraid of him, but just one look at the prude offspring of an ancient family, evoked a disgusting picture of the barefoot, which terribly wanted to erase forever from memory. He was always tempted to vomit when he happened to mention it again. And then there's the decent society... ...they didn't have Scary Square, where they'd be quick to try on a wooden mackintosh. Gross.    But today everything was quiet, the bathroom was free, so Ilya quickly rinsed himself, washing off the consequences of his heroic deeds, and then staggered downstairs. It took no more than five minutes for the boy to get through the evening routine. You can either learn to bathe in record time, under icy water, or you'll be in big trouble at the shelter. The elders won't wait... So free access to water, and hot water, seemed to the boy like manna from heaven. Free access to water, and hot water at that, seemed like a godsend to the boy. He was also a little more likely to be a guest of the world's foremost figures, and the Potions had been abolished.    With these thoughts the boy returned to the living room, then made his way to the bed, put his things away, and crawled under the covers. After such a difficult week, when every night his whole body was aching and all his muscles were aching, Ilya was happy to go to bed early. And tomorrow he had to get up at dawn and go to herbology...   The little bandit awoke to a high-pitched shriek. On reflexes and instincts the boy jumped to his feet, revealing both the butterfly and the wand at the same time. And what a picture he caught! To the left of his bed the darling roommates were piled up. Vincent and Greg were now supporting a pale Malfoy, and Theodore Nott was holding onto his right arm, covered in horrible, blackening, burn blisters. In fact, it was Nott who was screaming. Ilya looked more closely, and saw that the bastards were standing around his six-stringed baby girl (who could use a name by now).   - You weak-assed nits," the boy hissed and raised his wand, preparing to "cut with a kitchen knife" (beat with household spells).   At that very moment, the bedroom door burst from its hinges, and an enraged Snape flew in. Who'd have thought it - dressed in a black silk nightgown that looked more like a satanic sect's robe?    - What's going on here? - he hissed.   Even Nott, choking back tears and screaming in unbearable pain, lowered his voice. The rest of us were frozen in place, pillars of salt.   - I woke up screaming, sir," Ilya said. He must have had the toughest balls, because the rest of us were just whimpering. - And I saw these faggots... gentlemen, standing around my guitar.   - I wasn't asking you, Ilya," Snape continued to hiss. - Draco, I need a normal answer.   Malfoy instantly somehow sank down and hid his gaze.   - Professor, we wanted to play Ilya's guitar. That's all.   Ilya was furious. Yeah, right, they wanted to play. They were probably going to break the little girl again, so that they couldn't recover. The boy's eyes narrowed dangerously, and the knuckles of his left hand, where the knife rested, turned pale. That didn't escape Snape's scrutiny.   - I thought I told you to stop all this squabbling? - a viper would be jealous of his own tail if he heard such tones. - Vincent, Creb, take Mr. Nott and take him to the hospital wing. If you see Filch, send him to me.   The two big men swept Nott up in their arms like fluff and slipped out into the corridor.   - And you two, put on your robes and come with me.    The freshmen hurried to do as they were told, and in a moment they were fully clothed. Malfoy had an expensive winter robe with silver clasps, fur linings, and a brocade collar. It cost slightly more than Ilya's annual allowance. Illya's mantle was a simple black cloth that offered little protection against the cold winds that ranged through the castle. He was the local Prince and Pauper.   - Where are we going? - The blond man asked.   - To the principal.   - But...   - No buts, Draco, I'll talk to you again - later.   Now, even a dead man would have envied the whiteness of the serpent. The trio, escorted by the glances of heads peeking out of their bedrooms, left the living room and hurried to the third floor, where the entrance to the headmaster's tower was located. When the delegation reached the staircases, they seemed to shudder even slightly, rushing to the right position. Apparently Snape, in his sizzling anger, could make even the trees wince. In just a couple of minutes, the Dean and the two freshmen made it to the stone gargoyle blocking the way to the spiral staircase. Ilya had never been in the headmaster's office, and, to be quite frank, he had no desire to be there. But where it led a crooked path, at least magicians are not customary at the slightest chance to call the Pharaohs. And the local cops, the Aurors, were a real jerk. For them, such concepts as presumption of innocence and unproven guilt of a suspect are as important as civil rights for the rebels in South Africa. According to some of the books and newspaper clippings Ilyev had in his library, there was a lot of red-coat trouble even before the War in the Eighties. If you meet a werewolf girl, you snipe her, and then shoot her dead, allegedly while trying to escape. The same fate befalls vampires, and in general, any representative of the beautiful half of the dark magical creatures. There have even been instances of this - in one clipping, a boy saw a "crime scene". It was, I think, '75, almost the very beginning of the insane rebellion of the Dark Lord and his junta. So, an ordinary day in Lute Lane - sort of like Scary Square, only in a magical version. And on this very day, the werewolf family had no idea that their license to live off the reservation had been revoked due to an "accidental" bureaucratic error. As a result of a raid, and in a family - a beautiful mother, who was Muggle before the bite, her husband, known among the same Muggles, a fighter in the underground rings, a boy of nine and a daughter pretty - nineteen years old. Judging by the reports attached to the article, the male part of the family put up some serious resistance, and the Aurors were forced to take action. Two dead bodies in the end. Well, the ladies were captured and... killed trying to escape. And there's a whole lot of that going on.    Ilya, no stranger to the blackness of the street, had literally seen Auror visit the bar where the werewolf worked, wanting to take the young girl by force, and her father stood up for her and kicked the bastard out. And the next day the bureaucrats made a mistake, and the family was not the happiest of endings. If before the boy wondered why the ratio of the fascist-Voldemort junta to the country's fighters was 20:1, after that, no longer. And they fought so successfully because they were fighting, sort of, for a better life. The truth is, the boy also knew that the Dark Lord, who was too shy on blood purity, would unlikely fulfill his sweet promises, but he would rather enslave all non-blood mages, or slaughter them. But the people were tolerated, because they had nothing better to do than to live in fear every day. The funny thing is that the situation is no different now, and it's even worse-the laws against all kinds of "evil" are only getting stricter. There, wizards-vampires got their wands taken away, some kind of Umbridge is promoting law to deprive werewolves of the privilege, goblins are forbidden to provide construction services without sending tax to Ministry, which never happened before, centaurs want to make "pens" - reservations, mermaids are making clear list and making work on fish-farms, allegedly to work off duty to the country. In short, something in England is rotten - that's for sure. And Ilya was quietly glad that he wasn't some werewolf, vampire, goblin, centaur, giant, or whatever, but just a dirty girl.    - Orange slices," Snape muttered, and the gargoyle barely escaped disintegration as he hurried to open the door.   The dean almost threw the freshmen up the stairs. They struggled up the steep steps and soon stopped in front of heavy doors made of mahogany. Snape gave them a violent shove, opening the door to the study. It was a circular, spacious room, full of faintly strange sounds. A multitude of mysterious silver instruments stood on rotating tables-they buzzed, releasing small puffs of smoke. The walls were hung with portraits of former principals and headmistresses, all dozing peacefully in their handsome frames. In the center of the room was a huge desk, supported on clawed paws, and behind it on a shelf was a tattered, patched-up Wizard's Hat. Next to it was a tall perch on which sat a strange bird, as bright red as the sun at sunset, with its head under its wing.   The potionist led them to the table, seated them in the materialized chairs, and hissed:   - Sit. Be silent. Trembling.   Then, in his usual bat-like fashion, he flew out of the office, slamming the doors with force. In one of the many cupboards, filled with all sorts of things, something broke with a piteous squeak.   - It's always like this, Malfoy-boy," the boy sighed sadly. - You screw up, and everyone gets in trouble.   - Shut up, you bastard," the blond hissed, clearly mimicking Snape. He was bad at it, and the hissing was nothing short of hilarious.   - That's what I'm saying - fools.   After that the aristocrat gave a long and heartfelt speech about the superiority of pure blood, and that people like Ilya belong only at the foot of the throne, where the aristocrats sit. Ilya was not confused, and having slightly detached from reality, dozed off, lulled by the heartfelt speech. Priytsky dreamed about his friends, and how they were sitting on the bench in the shop and eating hot dogs stolen from a street vendor. The feast did not last long, for soon a piercing whistle sounded in the park and the hooligans were chased by patrolmen, who, apparently, lacked ticks in the list of solved cases. The kids then ran for nearly an hour until the chasers were trampled. The hot dogs were already cold, and the ketchup and mayonnaise had run out, but to be honest, Ilya had never eaten anything tastier than those cold buns, with the same cold sausages.    * * *    - Wake up, Mr. Ilya," a familiar voice woke Ilya.   The boy opened his eyes and saw that he and his classmate were no longer alone in the office. There were quite a few people here, in fact. Snape, frowning as usual, was standing in the corner, already donning his robes. McGonagall was sitting in a chair to the side of Albus, gnawing on sweets, her steely gaze fixed on Ilya. A little further away, Pomfrey was standing, biting her lower lip and twirling a bonnet in her hands. Right next to the boy, on the chair to the right, was Flitwick, his eyes twinkling slyly. On the left, Draco Malfoy was trying to squeeze into a chair and disappear. Ilya was becoming more and more convinced that the homo was a natural coward, the most stereotypical kind of coward and scoundrel.    - Is it morning already? - Ilya stretched, yawning sweetly.   - No, it's still night," McGonagall squeaked. - And because of your latest escapade, we professors have to scramble and rush over here.   - I didn't pull any of you by the noses," the lad said proudly, "so don't give me an unnecessary article.   - Mr. Ilya, speak plainly.   - Oh, I'm sorry, Professor Flitwick. It's just me being asleep.   - Did you use black magic in your sleep, too? - Snape hissed, making the boys flinch.   - I'm not and I'm not and the horse is not mine.   - Mr. Ilya!   - I didn't use any black magic! - I don't use black magic," cried Ilya. - And I didn't use blue, or purple, or green, or greyish-brown and crimson with yellow speckles, either! I am even a freshman, I only know how to tie my shoelaces with a stick and lift a vase into the air! And you're trying to get me in a criminal case, what's the big deal?! You're all like the cops on a little squirrel! I want a lawyer and a jury trial!   - Mr. Ilya, you're going over your vocabulary again," Flitwick seemed to be trying not to laugh out loud.   - Pardon me," muttered the bosun, pouting angrily, looking like a hurt kitten.   There was a girlish chuckle in the office and everyone turned to the hat, but it pretended to be asleep in its hat nap. The sly bitch.    - Poppy," the Iron Lady whispered wearily. - Tell me what you found out.   The healer froze and, putting on her cap, glared sternly at Ilya. He had already lost all bridge to what was going on and was simply poking his head in.    - When Vincent and Kreb brought Mr. Nott in, his arm was nearly dead. It took a lot of effort for me to identify the Inner Flame in the wound. I localized the lesion as quickly as possible, lest the flames be released higher up the arm, and then negated the effect of the spell. Theodore would need to be monitored for another week, and then he could be released to class. He would be able to use his arm for about six months, but I'm afraid it would never regain its former mobility.   - Wanking will be less," snorted Ilya, recalling that his right claw was injured.   - Mr. Ilya!" all the professors shouted together, even the headmaster. The poor bird has been woken up, its head is spinning like a propeller because of the shock.    - I didn't say anything," the boy hummed. - You heard him.   A pressing silence hung for a while.   - Two weeks of detention! - Snape and McGonagall barked together.   - With me," Flitwick chuckled. The boy smiled, too. Tea and biscuits and pleasant conversation awaited him.   - Filius, what are you doing here anyway? - I'm sorry," she asked McGonagall in a surly tone.   - Explain, Minerva.   - With pleasure. Severus is Dean of the boys, Poppy is the healer, I'm the vice-principal, Albus is the headmaster. And what is your relationship to Ilya?    - Did you all say Minerva?   - Yeah.   - That's fine.   If Ilya could, he would have laughed out loud, so Flitwick completely ignored McGonagall's innuendo, and the latter turned red with righteous anger. Dumbledore, on the other hand, continued to sparkle his eyes from under his half-glasses, remaining silent. The red bird, cooing, suddenly looked steadily at Ilya, who shuddered. What if a winged raptor, he had been awakened, and he wanted to eat. Now he pounced on the boy, he'll kill him, and he'll get another article - for the horrible treatment of animals. They're all over the place. They know how to make a case.    - Maybe they can tell me what they want to stamp by now.   - Ilya...   - What detrimental act does the local community of elders incriminate me with?   - Application of the Blackmagic Curse "Gemino," Snape hissed in his manner, but Ilya seemed to be becoming immune to that tone. - A curse that made the thing it was placed on burn with internal fire. And anyone who touches it will get the Inner Flame under their skin.   - Great," the boy coughed. - I'm not going to get the theory of relativity, either.    - Mr. Ilya!" the Iron Lady shouted, but Ilya paid no attention to her.   - Can you explain it in English? If it's difficult - I also know five-percent German and French with a dictionary.    - Professor Snape," Flitwick took the floor. - He thinks you stole a book on Dark Magic from the Forbidden section and used it to protect your belongings. He has good reason to think so, I admit, considering last year's incident.   - Did Madame Pince mention the missing books? - the boy suddenly burst out, grasping at the reservation like a life-saving straw. - I see he did not. Gentlemen in charge, you're making a white-trash case. No prosecutor is going to take up such a crap.    - Mr. Ilya," McGonagall almost shrieked. - One more word of that kind of vocabulary and you'll get six years' worth of detention!   - Ilya, pass the court your guitar," the director asked in a mocking tone.   - At this moment, your honour," replied the boy in tone.   The professors seemed to fall apart after that. But the boy was already fiddling with the case. He carefully pulled out his baby, glistening with scarlet-green threads, and carefully set it down on the table. At the same moment, the red bird fluttered off its perch and lowered itself directly onto the case. The flyer bent down and flicked its beak at the sixth string.   - Get the chicken away from the instrument! - the boy panicked.   - It's a phoenix, not a chicken," Flitwick chuckled.   - A phoenix," the boy wondered. He thought they were birds made of fire, according to science fiction, but here we are. - I'm not sure what you are, a penguin that can't fly.   - Fawkes, don't ruin the equipment," Albus snickered.   The phoenix named Fawkes cooed resentfully, then looked around and flew into the boy's lap. He marveled at the weight of what did not appear to be the largest bird. Almost against his will, the boy scratched the feathered creature's neck, and it now cooed happily, covering its eyes.   - A kiss-ass," Dumboldore smiled.   - Okay, penguin," the boy sighed. - I'll play you if you don't pull any more strings.   The phoenix let out a trill, then returned to his perch, looked around at the adults with stern, beady black eyes, and hid his head under his wing.    - As we all saw," the Headmaster coughed, drawing attention to himself. - Fawkes was in no way harmed by touching the guitar, and consequently," Albus threw up his left arm at that very moment, tugging the sleeve of his robes and lowering it briskly to the body.   - Albus, no! - McGonagall and Snape shouted together again.   A second passed, two seconds, a minute, but nothing happened. The director's hand was safe and sound, and the guitar was still lying on the table.   - Which was just as well," said Flitwick with a smirk.   The headmaster merely twinkled his eyes and removed his wrinkled paw from the instrument.   - I don't understand anything," the sallow-haired man whispered. The potter walked over to the instrument, reached for it, but without reaching a couple of centimeters, abruptly yanked it away. - There! There it was again! I felt the Gemino!   Now McGonagall reached for the instrument while Albus scrutinized it.   - Severus is right! - The professor nodded, jerking her hand away.   - Ilya, my boy," said the headmaster, calmly running his hand over the fingerboard, following the threads. - The green is from the glue, isn't it?   - Yeah.   - And the red one?   - Well, to hold the pieces together, I squeezed them hard, often splintering, so the blood got into the glue.   - Filius? - Albus turned to the halfling. - Do you mind...   The professor, without listening to the headmaster's speech, reached forward briskly and grabbed the base, he was just as well.   - What's with the Mordred? - Snape hissed. - The curse of the inner fire does not discriminate between victims!   - It's not a curse," Dumbledore shook his head.   - Then what is it? - Pomfrey spoke up for the first time in a long time.   - I'd say blood protection," the professors gasped for some reason. Ilya didn't know what blood protection was, but apparently it was cool. - But it was purely female magic, and a twelve-year-old wizard wouldn't have the strength, skill, or experience to do it, and neither would Gemino.   - You still haven't answered, Dumbledore," Snape hissed. - We are all wondering what witchcraft caused Theodore Nott to suffer, and that I should write to his parents.   - I'm afraid we won't know the answer to that question," Dumbledore shook his head. - As Filius told you six months ago, there are many wonders in magic and this is one of them. It seems to me that the guitar can't be touched by anyone whom Mr. Ilya doesn't trust. It does look like blood protection, but it's not. If it were otherwise, Mr. Nott would be dead.    - And why do all these miracles happen to you, Ilya? - Snape grumbled, closing his eyes tiredly.   - And we're all shelter people.   - Like what?   - Mysterious and wondrous.    Chapter 8.   Chapter 8.      March 12, 1992 Hogwarts, Ravenclaw Drawing Room.      The boy sat on the floor, leaning at the feet of seventh-year Evelyn Mispen, playing his guitar. He strummed the magical strings, and a light, cheerful melody emerged from under his frolicking fingers. Ilya played one of Tommy Emanuel's compositions, in fact, it was one of the few things the boy knew by heart. But that was enough for the students. They sat like mice, with their ears open, listening to the sound of the guitar. Even in the far corner, where the most zealous botanists usually gathered, the creaking of feathers on parchment and eternal grumbling on scientific topics faded away. The people listened, immersed in the warm music that shrouded the domed living room in a ghostly shroud. While Ilya, eyes covered, played, Evelina and her friends waved their sticks above his head. Actually, those gestures were the answer to what the boy was doing with the crows.   The boy's hair had grown back quite a bit. And just recently, just the other day, in Potions class, the cauldron at which Ilya and Daphne were standing, gurgled very happily, splashing a brown slurry on their aprons. At that very moment, Ilya realized that the next such gurgle, he could come upon his hair, and he would not get rid of the foul smell even in a thousand years. Without thinking, the boy grabbed the case (he always carried his guitar with him now, so as not to tempt the damn slugs) and took a brisk walk to Madam Pomfrey. He could literally see himself asking the healer to trim him down to a zero-five, but he'd better do the usual zero-three, of course. After all, he wasn't Harry Head-Pineapple-Potter, whose hair had more than one comb and a whole regiment of combs had mysteriously disappeared. And certainly not the pudgy Slytherin pseudo-aristocrat whose bangs could be tucked into his pants. Well, the boy was determined to get rid of that pile of hair, already hanging down to his shoulders. Only he did not consider the fact that the girls Seven-course, returning from an extra class, had their own opinion on this matter. They, seeing the boy running to Pomfrey, guessed everything, and did not let Ilya perform this act of "vandalism".   The boy was taken to the crow's nest, where he was immediately surrounded by local masters of stylistic magic. Evelina and Co. sat Ilya on the floor and began to actively argue what they had to do to make their plush toy shine with new colors. At that very moment, a Muggle-born sixth year walked into the living room. Of course, he couldn't pass up the chance to strum the guitar that was propped up against the chair. He carefully unzipped the case and already reached for the instrument, but at a distance of five centimeters from the six-stringed babe, as if he had run into an invisible wall. That was the new thing about the guitar.    After that incident the guitar spent a week in the office of Dumbledore, who was working magic on it and examining it at the same time. As a result, when the instrument was returned to its owner, no one but Ilya could reach it. Professor Flitwick, glaring at the little girl, stated that the Headmaster had put an altered spell of Inaccessibility on the instrument. And he - Flitwick - knew how to remove them, but would not do so, to avoid any incidents. And the boy didn't insist on demagnetizing either, the main thing was that the sound was coming through normally.    And so, when the sixth grader asked if Ilya could play, he only snorted contemptuously and touched the strings. Within a quarter of an hour, the living room was literally packed with Ravenclaws. All one hundred and thirteen of them were here, sitting, if not on top of each other's heads. And the boy, unaware of his growing audience, kept playing and playing. Sometimes he finished a composition and began to improvise in the mood without pauses, and then he suddenly moved to another piece, and the music, light, a little mysterious, somewhat ghostly, did not cease for a moment. But, alas, nothing could last forever.   - Here, have a look! - Mispen, with impatience, was jumping up and down on the sofa, giving the mirror to Ilya who had finished the game.    The boy accepted the glass, and when he looked at it, he nearly had a massive heart attack. His hair, once straight as a bicycle spokes, had become as wavy as a girl's. It was not as long as his shoulders, of course, but the girls cut it off, if only about three or four centimeters.    - How was it? - Well, asked the pretty sixth grader with the perpetual blush on her cheeks.   - I look like a mushroom," the boy muttered.   The living room rumbled with wicked laughter. The boy had been told hundreds of times before that a more hilarious picture than a sulking Ilya was hard to find. But Ilya was not confused. He quickly pulled out of his pocket a black homemade bandana with a picture of Jolly Roger. It was actually a new idea of the boy's. He, remembering his failures in occlusion and the staff's apparent successes in leglimancy, had concocted a bandana out of magic-insulating cloth that quietly guarded his mind. Quirrell's turban had given him the idea, though perhaps the ZoT professor himself used the same method of protection against telepaths. The boy pulled his hair back into a ponytail and wrapped a headband around his head. Then thought for two seconds and pulled one strand from the left side. The laughter in the living room ceased immediately.   - Hippogriff, I'll be damned! - Mispen's friend exclaimed. - Ilya, you're like the lead singer of the Witch Sisters anyway. Merlin, all the girls are yours.   - I'm not much of a vocalist," the boy snorted and cocked his chin proudly. - I'm the famous pirate, Ilya the Weasel. The terror of Hogwarts Lake, lord of the giant squid, and nightmare of all mermaids!   - Oh, Ilya," the same sixth-grader sighed heavily. - Why weren't you born five years earlier?   - Hands off Ilya! - Evelina laughed, putting her arms around the boy's neck and starting to squeeze him. Oh, those girls, maybe Ilya should give them a kitten? Let them torment him. It's certainly nice, though.    - Hey, kid, play some more! - shouted the shoulder-hugging headman.   - Yeah, play it! - The freshman echoed him.   - Play! Play! Chee-play! - chanted the whole living room.   The boy sighed heavily and reached for the instrument, regretting that he'd burned out his music-making abilities so haplessly.      April 28, 1992, Hovagarts, Transfiguration class.      The exams were coming up. Oh, that phrase would have made everybody shit themselves, and some who had grabbed their wands and other implements would have thrown themselves on the embrasure of knowledge. In the castle, at the height of spring, an impossible atmosphere reigned as usual, in which free-floating love vibes mingled with study fever in a mad brew. Ilya, who returned from his den at night, could have sworn with both wands (if you know what I mean) that a jamming spell hung on every fifth and tenth door (if, again, you know what I mean). Meanwhile, the fifth year was panting hard over their PSVs, the sixth year was sweating in the Great Hall in an apparatus class, and the seventh year was aboarding Hogsmeade for quills, ink, parchment, as well as valerian. All of this was in dire short supply on the eve of the Hogshead, and sellers were charging exorbitant prices.    But there were some people who didn't care about exams. Most of them were terrible slackers, hardened losers, jokers, and other representatives of the marginal stratum of the magical castle. The unspoken leaders of this underground organization were the notorious twins, whose maximum program to study at Hogwarts was to break into the bedroom of the Bat and wash his hair with shampoo. Though, Ilya reasonably thought that greasy-haired bastard put on his hair so magically protected that the guards Hog nervously smoking in the sidelines. But the twins weren't discouraged. Last week, for instance, they had stuck Filch in a suit of knight's armor and somehow tricked him into oblivion of this unfortunate fact. What was the public's defeat and astonishment when the rattling tin can, with bucket in hand and mop at the head, began to rush around the castle. Even the ectoplasmic ones were scared, and scaring a ghost is quite a non-trivial task.   Ilya also succumbed to the spring fever. He, who counted himself among the very marginal stratum, scored a "big, fat note" on his exams. After all, he could probably pass his credits and exams for his first year back in February, so the lad was literally inseparable from his six-stringed baby, managing to give gala concerts in all the drawing rooms, except the Slytherin one, of course. This added to the lad's popularity. And as for spring - the boy had absolutely no objection to kissing a pretty Hufflepuff and committing the same act with the insistent Lavender, but recently the girls had invented a new pastime for themselves. They called it "The Hunt for Weasel", as, at the slight suggestion of Ilya himself and the raven-raising, they began to call the handsome boy. The essence of the game was this: who catches the boy, and he "dances", but for some reason the girls did not ask whether he wants to play this game himself weasel. So Ilya had to apply all his Bosotian experience. He hid everywhere - from Weepy-Mirtle's toilet to Hagrid's hut.    The good-natured giant wasn't drooling either, by the last of the snows, he'd got himself... a dragon called Norbert. The same winged lizard, who loved to burn through everything and everyone, and who did not know how to live without nestling on Ilya's lap, has matured a lot. Earlier Fang had chased him, but now Norbert hissed at the dog, making him whimper under the table. Often, on his way back from Hagrid's with another batch of battle muffins, the boy had the good fortune to see the Trio hurrying toward the giant.    Speaking of him, the Trio, that is. After Ilya had passed on his message to Danger with a couple of inseparable friends, the Goldens had once again started treating Ilya more kindly than the average Slytherin. But for the past couple of weeks, Messrs. Potter, Weatherby, and Granger had been looking at Illya like a fox at a twisted hare's leg. Every now and then it seemed to the boy that he was being watched from around the corner, or that someone's wand was pointing at his back. But when he turned around, all he could see was nothing. In general, the reason for this bitterness was hidden from Weasel, but he did not grieve. If the masters of the great detectives and investigators had made up their minds, so did the drunken snot-nose to their backsides. Ilya had his own problems, or rather a problem. And a very important one. Bandana on his head, all his faces significantly lost in strength, apparently, the image of daredevil, a pirate, and so on and so forth, not very positively effect on the tender hearts of female staff. But in its updated form of Ilya, using the same smiley, could confuse even third-year students, and the crown, the years trained, wink through and fourth-year and some sensitive girls seniors. So it was either/or, and the boy couldn't make up his mind.    - Mr. Ilya, what are you doing? - a metallic squeak sounded.   Ah, yes, how could one forget the Iron Lady. That dog of the female sex, after the guitar incident, had become disillusioned with Ilya, and had clamped his balls in a vise of steel. Wherever the boy went, no matter what he did, he always felt the unseen gaze of the Dean of Scarlet. And the way she'd rubbed him the wrong way in class, it was just unforgettable performances. And no more muzzles or smiles worked on her- she was immune, the cat was a mess.   - Reading, ma'am," answered the boy, probably for the thousandth time this year, turning the page of an adventure novel with a touch of detective.    Ilya had found out that Muggle literature could be ordered by mail from a special shop, and now every three days owls flew to him with new books.    - What about your assignment?    Weasel nodded quietly at the porcelain statuette of a ballerina frozen in a dance. Once this tutu-clad beauty had been nothing but a box, but a couple of swings, a short formula, and, voila, you could put it in a shop window. The sheer number of hours spent in those four months on Animagia had seriously caught the boy in the simplest of transmutations. True, things were tight in Animagia itself, very tight. Ilya had so far, with great difficulty, transformed his right arm into a paw. It was a nice paw, with black, shiny hair, and a pad as white as the first snow. Things were much more positive in Numerology, where a magic counting-machine helped a lot, and in Runes, which were surprisingly easy. In the first area, anyway, the boy was well into his third chapter, and in the second almost finished the fourth, and even knew a few minor runes.    - I don't see you complying with it," McGee said calmly.   The boy wanted to object, then looked again at the corner of the table. The dancing girl had disappeared, and in her place there was again an uninteresting box. Ilya had once mastered all the wisdom of turning into an animal, and had turned into a fish. At least, with his face. He rolled his eyes and opened and closed his mouth silently.    Ilya looked hopefully at his neighbor Danger, beating on some ridiculous snuff box that still retained signs of a box. The nerd looked up at her beloved professor, then snorted contemptuously in Ilya's direction and returned to her task. Here it is - human "vleugernost", and as the girl zealously defended Zabini and Greengrass, but it was enough wind to blow in the opposite direction, and the champion of justice through his fingers looks at such blatant violation of all rights of free bosota, leader White Feather and so on and so on and so on.    - Ah, I'm sorry Professor, I'm so embarrassed," the boy shook his head sadly. - Uno momento, ma'am.   The boy waved his wand, whispered something, and a new porcelain figure appeared on the table. This time it was the right hand, clenched into a fist, but with the middle finger set back.   - What was that supposed to mean? - She was in the midst of her outrage, and McGee had forgotten that she should be shouting and raving and calling for work until the second coming. It didn't matter if it was Merlin or Christ.    - Oh, sorry again," Ilya sounded a ton of sarcasm in his voice. - I'll correct that in a minute.   A new wave, another formula and another figure decorates the table. Now the pupils, who were watching the traditional spectacle, were also frozen. There was a porcelain statuette in front of Ilya with a clearly phallic meaning. This phallic object, for some reason, had two handles. One raised an elegant bowler, while the other clutched a cane. Lady-balls looked like a beached fish now. Yes," the lad snapped, and, well, how could he not snapped?   Ilya hurricane shoved his things into his bag, grabbed his wand, threw on his case, and flew out into the hallway with lightning force, slamming the doors behind him. The sound of shattering stained glass was drowned out by the furious screeching of the Iron Lady. Let her squeal. Still, the magic of the gemstone hourglass is such that in order to remove the points, the headmaster or lecturer must look at the offender or the underdog. And if that weren't the case, faculties wouldn't score more than a couple of gems each. And she can assign workouts as much as she wants, anyway they all take place with Professor Flitwick, with whom Ilya drank tea and sharpened the government cookies every night anyway. But if any part of the goblin learns of such a trick, and he will, expect a whole pile of sharp, as a sword, jokes. And Flitwick's banter was much more witty and hurtful than Snape's. But the boy respected the professor for his solid, unyielding principles, for his impartiality and for the fact that the Master of Arts had his own way of covering Weasel's ass, and if necessary he could make him a long, slightly pathos-filled, but beautiful speech about honor and dignity. And, in principle, to teach him a little about life. And why not learn from the multiple European duel champion, and in his youth - a contender for the world championship. Then Filius was only half a kicks short to win the coveted Golden Stick and the most prestigious title, but now look behind him.    The boy quickly made his way down to the living room, which was not too crowded. The older ones were sitting in classrooms and study rooms, the younger ones were either outside or still in class. Marginalia and other unencumbered individuals were currently stationed in two places - the lakeside or the Quidditch field. So the castle in the midst of spring was rather empty. Ilya ducked through the corridor into the bedroom and flew up to his bed. He set the case on its special stand (Merlin alone knows what charms Flitwick had thrown on it, but this very stand was now scarier than a Haggard battle muffin), and then climbed into his trunk. Weasel briskly discarded the weathered, threadbare mantle, then discarded the threadbare gray shirt. Instead he donned a black T-shirt with the AC/DC logo on it. He also put on a pair of khaki-skin boots, still in good condition, and patent-leather slippers, now just shoes. He put on denim breeches with patches of different colors, then slipped on duct-taped sneakers. When he was done changing, he jumped up to check for any loose items so he didn't have to worry about chafing, but they looked fine.    He darted out of the living room, trotted through the branching corridors, and then out the front door of Hogwarts. Ilya walked through the small colonnaded walkway, past the beautiful large fountain in the center, and staggered toward the Quidditch pitch.    Here, far from the castle, almost at the edge of the forest, was his favorite spot: a small hill covered with tall, almost knee-high grass. It offered a peaceful view. To the northwest, distant mountains with snow-capped peaks. To the east, the water smooth surface of the lake, where every now and then one could see a squid's head poking out, critically examining its possessions. And, of course, the forest itself.   In general, Ilya had a history with this forest. The first time he visited it was in late autumn, out of sheer curiosity, wandering the paths and lanes there until he was snatched up by Hagrid. You may remember the impression this black-bearded giant had made on the young wizard. So when the giant emerged from the forest gloom directly towards the boy, smiling at the full twenty-nine (the boy didn't know it was a "Good" smile yet), Ilya was ready to sell his life for dearer. But, as history shows, there was nothing to sell, except to drink chifirka and chew stone muffins - Ilya almost had twenty-nine teeth from them himself, if not sixteen. Hagrid was still raving about what Merlin was doing in the dangerous Forbidden Forest, where getting lost was a chore. The boy shook his head, believing that in the Wizarding Forest, with its endless paths, only Potter, Weasley, and Granger could get lost. They, by the way, had just the other day been caught for their nightly vigils, and ended up getting fifty points off of them, each of them. Malfoy was somehow involved in this story, but Ilya didn't know the details - he had little interest in other people's problems.   Then winter came, which wrapped the forest in snow, and the boy somehow forgot about it, concentrating on his own explorations, improvement of the den, Animagia, music-making, cuddling with girls and other boyish things. But then spring came, and Ilya was drawn to nature again. No, not by any overpowering feeling that he couldn't resist. It was just the impression that the boy was invited into the forest, promising that he could leave at any moment, but also that he could return at any moment. So the boy would come running up here to the hill, where he would lie hidden in the grass for long periods of time and enjoy the sound of the wind in the crown and the crackling of the trees bending in a whimsical dance.   As always, Ilya plumped down on the ground, put his hands under his head, exposing his face to the warm spring sun, then put a sour grass in his mouth and even dozed off. But he didn't let the boy lie for a long time. The wind blew, bringing with it a light coolness and quiet whispering of rustling leaves.   - Hee-hee-hee-hee," the boy heard a distant, girlish laugh.   Ilya opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the clearing. There, among the bushes and lower, swaying branches, he discerned a few blurry silhouettes that disappeared a moment later. Ilya suspected something wrong and contemplated walking away to the castle, but curiosity eventually overpowered. The young man bent his elbows, placing his palms on the ground next to his neck, then tucked his knees, swung back and soared through the air in one jerk, landing on his feet. It was a simple trick Rosie had taught him a long time ago.    He walked quickly to the edge of the forest, but he saw nothing but bushes and low branches covered with green foliage. He was about to leave when suddenly someone hugged him from behind and breathed warmly in his ear. He turned around and saw misty, fuzzy figures in the foliage again. They were some kind of cloudy girls, woven of black and green lines, merging in the wind of branches and foliage.    - Catch up," the boy heard in the rustling.   Ilya stood still for a while, and then suddenly smiled broadly and rushed out of the way. There was joyful, gurgling laughter everywhere, and the boy kept running, as if trying to catch up with the wind that was teasing him. At times he had already touched those unreal figures that didn't show their faces, but as soon as he opened his arms, it wasn't a cloudy maiden camp, but a tree trunk or prickly bush that caught his arm. But the boy paid no attention to this.   He froze, hiding behind a tree, and then poked his head out. The boy saw these ladies, woven from leaves dancing in the wind. He straightened, pressed himself against the trunk, then jerked sharply to try to reach one, but all he heard was laughter. And a moment later the boy tumbled into the creek, wetting his pants.   - Funooooo," the wind brought.   The boy suddenly laughed merrily, with a laugh more reminiscent of a spring drip.   - Well, I'll show you! - He shouted and jumped up from his seat.   - Play along," was his reply.   Ilya ran again, he ran without noticing anything around him. He didn't notice how he left his sneakers that had slipped off in the stream. He didn't notice how he ran barefoot, how he carefully placed his foot, skirting every pebble, every protruding stub. He didn't notice how the wind danced around him, carrying leaves and illusory shapes. He did not notice how a fox, sleeping peacefully in the shade, suddenly jumped up, moved his nose, and then, barking merrily, rushed in pursuit along with the child.   - Hee hee hee," sang the wind.   The boy did not see how the gray hare, not at all afraid of its natural enemy - a terrible predator, clapped its ears and began to gallop around the runner, as if joining the merry game. He did not notice how the birds driven from the branches did not tend to fly away, but on the contrary, they flew closer, hovering in the wind, flitting rapidly among the trees, accompanying the race.   - Jolly oooh," the leaves whispered.   Ilya did not see how easily and casually he jumped over the ravine, which could not be jumped over by a tall centaur. He did not see how the sniffer, who lived in this valley, suddenly climbed out of his hole, sucked the air with his long nose and dived under the ground. And already there the lover of jewels and gold as if flew through the firmament along with the others.    The boy saw only laughing figures that seemed to float among the foliage, dissolving into the swaying bushes and emerging from the crowns. They were so close that it seemed as if he could reach out and touch them. Here the boy rushed forward, but only wrapped his arms around a red bush. Ilya did not notice a scarlet blossom under the bush, a fire in which the thick salamanders were lounging. Here one of them opened its eyes, and then licked the boy's foot, leaving behind its slimy tongue blue patterns. But the boy had already scrambled away, not at all noticing that he was standing in the flames, and certainly not noticing the peculiar ornament on his feet.    And here comes a bow-trunk, pretending to be a knoll on a thick willow trunk, suddenly sprouts and whirls around the boy's head, and then, catching a wave of wind, soars somewhere upwards. Ilya kept running, bursting with happy children's laughter, whirling among unreal figures, dissolving in the surrounding greenery and diving into the sunlight penetrating through the crown. And then it stopped. It was as if some evil person had turned off the projector, plunging the audience into darkness and silence.   The laughter died down, the figures evaporated, the birds scattered, whimpering, the animals scurried away, and even the cute sniffer burrowed into the ground. Ilya suddenly collapsed to his knees, hugging himself by the shoulders. He felt sick to his stomach. He was vomiting mercilessly and his eyes were stinging with a horrible stench. Oh yes, that stench was ten times stronger than what he'd felt when he'd encountered the troll or stood at the cauldrons. It was even stronger than the sloping rot coming from the Zellevar's office. It was such a horrible, disgusting, luscious smell that the greenhouse didn't hold back the urge. And when he vomited up anything but blood, he felt a panicked, animal terror. Don't get any ideas, Ilya wasn't some cowardly puppy, he'd always fought his own fears skillfully and never lost. But this was something more powerful, something heavier and darker than ordinary fear. It was something the boy had never experienced before.   - Run," the wind whispered, if I may say so.   - Save yourself," the rustling of the crowns rustled inaudibly.   And the boy ran, but no more laughter and chirping of birds could be heard. But Ilya still did not notice anything. He did not see and did not feel how the twigs whipping across his face cut his face, how the stones and roots bleeding his feet, how the scarlet, dark liquid hides the blue pattern. The boy didn't notice or feel anything, only because he could feel it. He felt that if he stopped, if he stopped running for a moment, something terrible, something irreparable, would happen. Something that could not be looked at, could not be heard, could not be spoken to, could not even think about, would touch him. It will touch him and take away a very important thing without which you are not you, without which the world is only a grey, blurred blur, only a dull prison. And the lad ran, ran as if he were being chased by the devil himself, who had come out of the underworld in search of fresh prey. He raced, and the branches tore at his shirt and skinned his shoulders, and his feet became nothing but a bloody blur, shimmering in the air, leaving a scarlet drip behind him.   In the distance a tall bush appeared, and the boy, without thinking, jumped into it, but there was no support under his feet, and Ilya tumbled down. He rolled down the slope, and the stones hammered his back, and the roots whipped with the agility of a negligent chaser's whip. In a couple of moments he felt a terrible blow that knocked all the air out of his lungs at once. His eyes blackened and the world spun in a kaleidoscopic frenzy, blending heaven and earth and everything in between into one indecipherable blur.    - Ilya? - he heard the boy's familiar, thick bass.   The boy, exasperated by the pain, rose up and saw an altogether maddening sight. There was a pile of people standing in front of him. There was Hagrid, lantern and crossbow in hand, a pale Malfoy who reeked of shit, Potter with his glasses twisted, Weasley about to burst into tears, and a worried Granger. Three centaurs also stood there, one with a long, black spear, the other two with rose bows, which, for these half-horse, were akin to ordinary bows.    - Hagrid! - The boy exclaimed, coughing up blood and jumping up on his shattered legs. - We have to run!   With these words, Ilya rushed forward, but he was instantly encased in a truly bear hug.    - What's the matter with you, Ilya? - the forester was clearly concerned. - Did it attack you? And why run?   - Why... - and then Ilya realized that he didn't feel that all-consuming terror squeezing his heart in a rusty vise. He felt quite normal, not even worried at all. - Uh, really, don't. What are you doing here? On a field trip or something?    - No! What are you doing here? - Potter shouted, clenching his fists.   - Me?" the boy wondered. - I went for a walk, to sit in the woods.   - At night? - Hagrid snickered.   - No, during the day," the boy shook his head, and then froze. It was indeed night, a cold wind was blowing, and the growing moon was glittering in the sky. - Yebich* * *a* power. Pardon my French. I'll give you that - out for a walk right after my transfiguration lesson!   - Mars is shining brighter and brighter," the mane-haired centaur mouthed.   This was enough for Ilya to finally lose the bridges with reality and began to engage in what had already become a habit - plugging.    - Uh, well, that, thank you," Hagrid was strikingly eloquent, as usual. - We'll take it from here.   - We'll meet again, Harry Potter," one of the ungulates cheered and the whole trio gorged themselves into the nearest bush.    When they were almost out of sight, the one with the spear suddenly turned around and stared intently into Ilya's eyes.   - Humans don't bring happiness," the boy heard the rustling of the crowns. The centaurs were gone.   - Well, let me take you to the hut," muttered Hagrid, slipping the crossbow onto his other arm. - You can get to the castle on your own, but I have a letter to write to Dumbledore. By the way, don't say anything about today. You, Malfoy, are particularly concerned.   From this rather intricate speech not the last expert on jargon - Ilya understood only that he did not understand shit. The world was finally going mad. Delegation of dwarves, led by Gandalf the Black, or it had already been somewhere... Anyway, it didn't matter. The Firstborn, led by Hagrid along the wide path, were marching toward the castle. At the head of the march was the Trio, burning through Ilya's gaze, with Malfoy ahead, clutching at Fang's collar like a drowning man clutching a life preserver.   - Hagrid, why don't we take the next path? - the boy stretched out. - There's no point in taking that one, is there?   - What trail? - The forester scowled.   - That one," the boy poked at his feet.   - Ilya," Granger hissed sarcastically. Oh, no pie, is she Snape's daughter? She takes these tones... - You've got some nerve with your jokes, haven't you?   - Are you people even normal? - Ilya exhaled, astonished.   - There are no trails! - Weasley barked.    The boy turned hopefully to Hagrid.   - Ilya, you should go see Poppy, you're covered in blood.   - It's a scratch," the boy muttered.   - Not the wounds, I see," Hagrid tried to joke, but clearly he wasn't succeeding.   - All right, fine. There are no trails, and I'm actually a squint-eyed pterodactyl caught in a time loop and transported to a distant future. And you guys aren't wizards, you're aliens who have curbed the laws of the universe. Yeah, it's a less crazy version than the reality that surrounds me...   So, to the disgruntled grumbling of Ilya, the delegation reached the hut. It was a short walk to the gate where Filch was waiting. Hagrid, having exchanged a few words with Potter, sent the children off along the familiar route. He had to keep Malfoy and Fang apart for five minutes. Both of them were still awake, and the blond stank too badly of shit.       - Okay, Malfoy-boy," Ilya said quietly when the group was roughly centered between the forester's lodge and the Main Entrance to the Hog. - Go on, make your move.   - What?" Draco, shocked and terrified, had forgotten his trademark insults.   - I say march your buns at a waltzing pace.    The hereditary aristocrat, surprisingly, nodded and literally took off, rushing toward the castle. Ilya was already planning to ask Trio to linger, but they stopped on their own and even drew their wands. What a twist...   - Now, you alcoholics, tell me, why are you campaigning so hard to lower the amount of blood in my veins?   A mute scene was his answer.   - What have I done to you? - the boy asked tiredly.   - You know," Weasley almost spat.   - Weatherby, I'm not like you, I'm not a knucklehead. If I understand something, I don't ask.   - You told Malfoy about the dragon! - Hermione exclaimed.   - You're helping Snape steal the Philosopher's Stone! - He was in the middle of a fight with her, and he was looking at her as if she were sick.   But Ilya himself looked at the whole trio as if they were sick. What a horrible brew the Griffins hide in their living room... And the most offensive question is why they do not share.    - If I understand correctly. Did you just accuse me of stealing, but, importantly, of snitching?   No one noticed, but Ilya's right fist whistled into the redhead's face, who collapsed on his ass, his hands clasped in a fountain of blood. Potter threw up his wand, but buckled in pain as a pebble that flew off the ground crashed between his legs. The next instant, Harry's hand, still clutching his wand, was glued to his groin.   - Rictumsempra! - Hermione shouted.   Ilya collapsed, letting the colorful beam pass over him.   - Boilo! - Weasel cast a household boil spell on Granger's arm, and she shrieked and dropped her wand. And don't go snapping berries on the way, their juice boils just fine too. Following that, Ilya wasted no time in applying three Petrificus. Then rose to his feet and leaned on his knees to catch his breath. Yes, such adventures were not like fighting with criminals, everybody was fucking armed. But how well he'd done them! With the Domestic Charms and the Levitation Charms, that's for sure. I'll have to tell Flitwick.    - Anyway, listen up and pay attention," Ilya growled, hovering over his fallen classmates. They all stared at the handsome slitherer with rage and scorn now, eyes spinning furiously in their eye sockets. - To begin with, Mr. Holmes, Mr. Columbo, and . Mrs. Marple, what the hell is a philosopher's stone? I've never heard of it, except to tell you detectives about it, and that's the end of my knowledge of it. And now for the main thing...   With those words, Ilya walked up to Weasley and with all his might, kicked his heel into his nose. A small bloody splash shot into the air. After that, Weasel took a hearty, drawn-out punch to his ribs, and finished with another on his nose, which was already a bloody mess.    - That's for pissing me off, Ginger. And for daring to say that Ilya was a snitch. In the place where I lived, the act of ratting on a subhuman was a blasphemous act, after which he usually hanged himself or slit his wrists. So if any more of you detectives dare call me a snitch, I'll cut you. Comprende?   Which isn't surprising - no one responded.   - That's good. Don't you worry, frogs. My Petrificus is weak, you'll be dead in twenty minutes. And Madam Pomfrey can fix a mess like this without a scar. So long, flock of cormorants.    Ilya jammed his wand behind his belt, threw his hands behind his head, and staggered to the castle. It had been a crazy day. It was time for bed, anyway. Chapter 9.   May 6, 1992. Hogwarts, Flitwick's study.      - I heard," the Master of Enchantments said quietly, sipping his tea. - Ronald Weasley was discharged from the hospital wing today.   Ilya tensed inwardly and got ready for the showdown. Now he was going to be pestered about self-mutilation and the inadmissibility of a school showdown. But what kind of a showdown is it: just a little dullard, so that he thinks sometimes. It was, in principle, a useful lesson for the trio - at least they've stopped their invisible surveillance, and are even too embarrassed to tell the professors what's going on. He was lying on a ladder, but the professors couldn't figure out what kind of ladder if Pomfrey couldn't get the boy out of it. He ended up spending a week in hospital with two broken ribs and a bloody mess on his nose. But Poppy fixed him, and he got his face fixed in such a way that it looked better than it had before. She had been shaking her hands the whole time and wondering why most of the potions in her healer's range weren't working. Only the strongest, most potent ointments and brews helped.    - Yes," the boy nodded mournfully.   Flitwick squinted laughingly and popped a liver into his mouth, crunching appetizingly. The boy almost instinctively reached for the vase.   - Mr. Ilya, why are you so tense?   - I'm waiting.   - My "next lecture," I presume? - There was laughter in the caster's voice.   - Something like that," Weasel agreed.   - Oh, Mr. Ilya, you don't know me very well," he shook his head. - Tell me, Ilya, what have you got?   - Uh...   - I see the exams have exhausted even you. Well, you, Ilya, have only honour and a stick. Just those two things, as unfortunate as it is for me to say it. And if someone, no matter who, wants to take something from your list, you have the right to stop him in any way you can apply and for which you are ready to answer.   Ilya froze and stared into the old man's mocking gaze. It was clearly not what he expected.   - So you don't judge? - with a slight hope in his voice, the boy asked.   - Condemnation? - Flitwick laughed his own snarling laugh. - Merlin forbid. It's very easy to judge someone, it costs nothing, and sometimes it's even pleasant. But to understand... Anyone can judge, Mr. Ilya, but only a few can understand. So, my advice to you is to stick to those who can understand.   - I mean you," said Ilya sneeringly.   - Have mercy, Ilya. I'm too small to be worth holding on to.   Ilya laughed. The goblin had a way of making fun of himself that lifted his spirits in the blink of an eye.   - Thank you, Professor.   - You're welcome, Ilya. You're absolutely welcome.      May 16, 1992, Hogwarts.      - Are you sure you can handle it?   - Of course.   - I want to warn you again: Ilya is a boy with a very complicated character and a complete lack of respect for anyone at all. Except for those who have somehow made themselves respected.   - Professor, it's not for us to tell you how to deal with difficult children, we have more than one of them growing up.   - Yeah, but none of them were ex-gangsters.   - Bronchitis?   - Bandit, bandit. It's a Muggle term.   - And what does this thermos mean?   - Term, term. It means that Mr. Ilya is no stranger to the underworld. He's been a part of it for quite some time.   - Oh. A juvenile delinquent and a Slytherin. Honey, are we sure we can handle this?   - Of course it is. Yeah, and the extra subsidies won't hurt us.   - That's not all - Mr. Ilya is likely to treat you as the enemy.    - But we can't abandon a child in such a difficult situation! He deserves to have a happy childhood.   - I think our notion of a happy childhood, and Ilya's notion of it, are diametrically opposed.    - We'll get through this, Professor.   - Well, if you're still confident in your abilities, I'm obliged to lay out one last counterargument.   - Companion?   - Counter-argument, counter-argument. Mr. Ilya thinks he's a Muggle.   -...   - You see, the thing is, it's one of the most famous psychological clichs. Muggleborn orphans who enter the world of magic tend to fall into two camps. Those who adhere to the first believe that they are divinely chosen and marked by destiny itself. The adherents of the second, on the other hand, secretly adhere to the familiar environment, believing that they are ordinary people who are lucky enough to own a magic wand.   - It's going to be difficult...   - That's why I feel it's my duty to tell you all the cons. And to try to talk you out of it.   - What's the upside?   - People like Ilya hold their debts sacred and never forget them.   - You want to make the boy obligated?   - Maybe...   - We agree.   - I hope we won't all regret it. I wish it was the right decision...      May 23, 1992, Hogwarts, Spellcraft class.      Ilya stood in the corridor among the freshmen, twirling the wand in his palm. He deftly passed it between his fingers, spinning it like a drummer's drumstick, and then tossed it low and intercepted it with only his thumb, spinning it in the air again.    - Stop showing off," MacDougall hissed.   - Sorry," Weasel smiled. - I can't help it.   - I'm going to faint," Lavender hissed. - Merlin, it's so scary.   Parvati, standing beside her friends, nodded assiduously and turned rapidly pale. Then the door creaked open and Seamus Finigan stepped out. He looked very sad and pale, but his cheeks were rosy.   - Well, how's that?    - What was?    - Tortured much?   The questions were pouring in from all sides. As usual, the subject exam was held by the whole class and lasted from dawn till dusk. Finigan, unaccustomed to such attention, began to stammer and explain something confusingly. He was saying that the writing part hadn't been checked by Flitwick yet, and that the practical part was kind of archaic and all that. Many girls, and boys too, went into a stupor after this statement and lost touch with reality.   - Ilya, Ilya!" came a metallic voice.   - Eh," the boy fixed his bandana and waved. - Don't mention it, brothers!   - Good luck! - was coming from everywhere.   - Lavender, honey," the boy hugged the blushing girl tightly and faked a sob. - Tell our cat it wasn't me who pulled her tail. Tell your beloved grandmother, I stole the Validol. Tell the kids they're not yours and don't ask me how that's possible. # How I've loved this life # I'm so young to...   - Poseur! - Granger snorted, supported by her friends.   But the rest of the crowd seemed to cheer up and started smiling. Ilya opened his arms before Brown went completely into the astral and, winking at the audience, ducked into the office, closing the doors behind him.    Flitwick was sitting in a chair in the amphitheater, twirling his wand just as Ilya had done a few minutes before. Who, in fact, had taught the lad such a trick - the master of enchantments, of course. In front of the professor was a table of various fruits. There were apples, two watermelons, a pineapple, bananas, grapes, plums, even figs. The boy fell out at first, but then quickly pulled himself together. He pulled up a chair and sat down opposite.   - Are we having a buffet? - the boy inquired.   - Hmm," the master of spells pondered. - It would be nice, but that much sweetness would make even Dumbledore... I was thinking about it, but even Dumbledore had that much sweetness in him.   - But you didn't say either," the boy indignantly said.   - That's the trick," the goblin winked at some part of him.    - Professor, I think you're teaching an innocent me some very bad things.   - You got me there, Ilya. My purpose in life is to plunge you into the abyss of darkness and chaos.   - Oh, my gosh! I should probably run.   - Where to, Ilya? The doors are locked, and you can't break the window.   - I will fight!   - With what?   - With this!   - With a toothpick?   - You're being shortsighted, Professor. It's actually an ancient Atlantean weapon. The super-duper-ultra-wizard toothpick. It's made of all types of wood, and its core is the heart vein of a hundred-year-old virgin.   - Are you sure there are such things? - The good-natured old man asked with a chuckle.   - No," Ilya shook his head, smiling from ear to ear. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.   - Then I think you can show me something interesting with this toothpick.   - Right now!    The boy waved the toothpick, but nothing happened.   - Can I get a bigger one?   - As you wish.   Ilya pulled his wand from behind his belt and concentrated. We had to hit the professor, which meant... The boy bit his lower lip, then swung his wand and uttered a long formula. Alternately, each fruit transformed into either a plastic man in a tuxedo or a girl in a ball gown. Ilya felt weakness creep in. Transmutation hadn't been too difficult for him lately, though with the most talented pureblood first-borns in Transfiguration, such a trick wouldn't have caused any difficulty at all. But only Ilya could do the next one. After all, no one had sweated as hard over the Charms as this mudblood, who had spent more than two thousand hours and a couple of liters of blood pounding from his nose in a year on them.    Ilya waved his wand, whispering the magic words softly, and each of the men bowed to the girl. He waved again, whispering others, and the girls curtsied. Then the weasel began to wave his cherry friend like a conductor in front of an orchestra. Couples suddenly whirled around the table, some danced a waltz, others a tango, there was also a latino and even a twist. The boy had seen all these dances on TV, which the manager liked to watch. He himself, of course, could only waltz, and then only because the older girls had taught him. But for magic it was not necessary to know, it was enough to see. It took Ilya less than twenty seconds, after which the figures froze, and then turned back into fruit.   - I'm glad to see, Mr. Ilya, that disrupting the school routine is doing you good.   Ilya only nodded, feeling that in the next few hours he wouldn't even be able to hold a spoon in his hands. That was his maximum.   - Perhaps," a cheerful Flitwick went on, "I can't give you an 'A' on your exam. I hope you're only satisfied with one?   - Only if you haven't forgotten about the bet," the boy said with a hard, long pause.   - A bet?   - Huh. You never caught that broomstick thief.   Flitwick suddenly smiled predatorily and flashed his eyes the color of steel.   - I remember. But, as we agreed, a pleasant surprise will be waiting for him after the holidays.   - Weasel will be looking forward to it.   - I don't doubt it," the charms master nodded, then looked intently at the young man. - I'd offer to help you get to the infirmary. But I'm afraid you'd try to curse me for such an offer. And you wouldn't go to Poppy, either.   - You know me too well," the boy smiled crookedly, coming to his senses.   - I hope so," Professor Char nodded a little belatedly. - Go on, Ilya. That was the best freshman exam I've taken in fifteen years. You can be proud of yourself.   Ilya just nodded, swaying slightly, got up from the table and with a familiar, practiced movement, jammed his wand behind his belt, then headed for the door. He paused at the exit and turned around.   - I'm always proud of myself," the boy smiled his dashing, pirate smile.   - That's right, Ilya," Flitwick grinned, adjusting his glasses.    The boy came out of the room, and he was attacked in the same way as Seamus, though this time there was fear in the boys' eyes. If Ilya, the best student of the first year, the man who hadn't received a single grade below "P" all year, was as white as a sheet after the exam and his hands were shaking, then what could the others expect? The people were speechless and looked anxiously at the kid leaning against the wall. Ilya was breathing heavily, trying to calm his racing heart. It wasn't critical magical exhaustion, so he'd be a cucumber by nightfall, but right now it was like running a marathon at full speed.    - What was it? - Janstin Fin-Fletchley, the unkempt Hufflepuffer who annoyed Ilya wildly with his limitedness and stupidity, asked worriedly. Two peas in a pod, both Justin and Ronald the dumb-ass gorilla Weatherby.   - Hell," Ilya wheezed. - Almost died. Flitwick was a real prick. Barely made it out alive.   - Come on, you're joking," a pale-faced MacDougall brushed aside.   The boy only stared at her, then staggered back to the dungeons, wishing he could just curl up on his bed and sleep for at least eternity. Or at least a couple of hours' nap before supper. The gentlemen parted before Ilya like the sea parted before Moses.   - Hey, Ilya, you're kidding, right? - Lavender called out. - Well, that was a joke, wasn't it?   Ilya didn't answer and disappeared around the corner.       May 28, 1992, Hogwarts, Transfiguration Room.      Ilya sat in the front row, staring at his box. McGonagall had summoned him last, and the boy had to sit at the door all day like a beaten dog at the doghouse. And how much had been planned for a bright Friday afternoon! It was hard to imagine how much the Iron Lady had spoiled the boy's mood.   - Turn the box, Mr. Illya, into a snuffler," McGonagall, seated behind the lectern, asked.   No, he can't even get a proper trap. Who sets traps like that?   - First of all, we didn't go through the transformation of the inanimate into the living. And secondly, nothing can be turned into a being with magical essence.   - I agree with the second one, but it is not written in any regulations that I have the right to ask at the exam only passed material.   Ilya's ass. It was a double trap. If he hadn't snapped and noticed about the advanced transmutation, McGee wouldn't have been able to push the regulations speech. Devil, he was made clean. Skilled bitch. What did she dislike him for? I mean, he's done nothing to her, and she's still watching him like a wolf. Maybe she's got a granddaughter or a niece in the castle who happened to fall in love with Ilya. That would explain the situation.   The professor, meanwhile, peeled off a white mouse onto the boy's desk. The Dean of Scarlet's eyes glittered with victory flames. No, what kind of woman. Rejoicing in victory over a twelve year old orphan. Does she even have a heart, or is there a stone frozen in there? Snape and McGee are the same color. Their guts are equally sparse.    - Turn the mouse into a cat, Mr. Ilya.   - And if I can't?   - I'll give you a "T" and I won't pass the exam.   Yeah, failing an exam is a scary thing. It meant that during the first semester of his sophomore year, every other night the kid would go to practice sessions under McGee, where he would be forced to repeat material from the previous course. So that's how the professor decided to keep an eye on the kid. Bitch.   - What if I can do your assignment? Even though it is third-year material?   - I don't know what you mean, Ilya. Execute and execute. I'll give you an appropriate grade.   The boy hummed and rolled up his sleeves, exposing his wand.   - I hope, ma'am, your honor is enough to keep your word.   McGonagall twitched like a slap in the face, and Weasel mentally thanked Flitwick for such useful lessons. But there was witchcraft to be done. Ask the bitchy lady to turn a mouse into any animal, even the same rat, and there was a ninety percent chance the lad would have failed. But the cat... Ha, he's been trying to turn himself into that animal for six months now, and the other one... There was no problem with that, as long as there was enough magical power. As the kid had already figured out, he wasn't the strongest mage you could find among the first-worlders. Ron-mother-Weasley and even Granger-Danger were stronger than he was magically. But the esteemed Master Char loves to say that magic isn't about fighting over clubs to see who can crack who harder. Magic is the subtle, graceful art of battle with sharp rapiers. Jab, dodge, dodge, jab, lunge, dodge, dodge. Strength is only a nice bonus, the art is the foundation. After all, Flitwick himself, by virtue of his blood, was several orders of magnitude weaker than anyone he fought in the ring, but few could overpower him.    Ilya, covering his eyes, recalled the formula and the sweeps, and then in a single rush he fulfilled the required condition. In an instant, he felt every vein being pulled out of him, and blood trickled down his lips and chin, gushing from his nose. Critical magical exhaustion - he'd have to cower in pain all night. Bitch.    The boy opened his eyes and saw a beautiful Persian cat. The furry cat rose to his feet, looked around, hissed at McGee as if she weren't an anima-cat, and then jumped onto the boy's lap and began rubbing his cheek. With each such rubbing, the boy felt the pain go away, and it became easier to breathe.   - Evanesko! - growled the professor. The cat disappeared with a loud meow.   The boy couldn't believe his eyes. She had killed him. Killed a small, defenseless creature. Breathing, living, bright and free. How could she?!   - You get your 'P', Mr. Ilya," the Iron Lady gritted through her teeth. - Now get out of my classroom.   The boy said nothing, said nothing, or objected. He just gathered his things, threw his guitar case on his shoulders, and, tucking his wand behind his belt, walked out into the corridor. Closing the doors, he looked at the Gryffindor dean red with rage. One day, even if it was many years from now, he would get his revenge on her for killing the white furry. He'd given himself his word, taken it upon himself to do his duty. And Ilya of Scary Square never forgets a debt. Neither his own nor anyone else's.       June 2, 1992, Hogwarts, ZoT room.      - Now, I'm going to ask you to demonstrate the Petrificus spell to me," Quirrell said as he sat at the desk.    Ilya himself stood at the board and looked at the mannequin, which had to be struck with various spells. It was probably the most uncomplicated exam. No, Ilya's curses were still weaker than any student in the castle, with the exception of "genius" Longbottom of course, but their application did not cause the kid any difficulty. And the marksmanship of Bosoth, who since the age of six had attended the shooting range, where he shot not for prizes, but for food, was beyond praise. Ilya, who had no problems with his eyesight, could hit a drop on a kanat coin from twenty paces. And here was a huge target on a dummy, where a "bullseye" is five centimeters in diameter (after the lessons of Animagy, Numerology and Runes, the guy switched to the metric system - otherwise it would be tiring to translate values for calculations), and even a distance of ten paces. It was child's play, not an exam.    The boy quickly conjured up his weakest Petrificus spell, which pierced the center of the target with a colorless beam, and the dummy's eyes turned purple for a few moments, indicating a hundred percent hit. Harry Potter's Petrificus was the kind that would cast, and then Pomfrey would take it off, and if he didn't, it would only take a day or a day and a half before the spell came off. Ilya, on the other hand, has twenty minutes, and he's as good as a cucumber. And after the tenth minute, the cursed will be able to move some part of the body. And after the fifteenth and even partially come to his senses. It's a shame, of course, but what can you do? I was in the middle of a fight with nature.   - Clint Eastwood is resting, Mr. Ilya," the boy marveled at the professor's knowledge of Muggle culture.    The boy smiled dashingly and blew on the tip of his wand, twirling it in his fingers.   - Tickle spell, please.    The pink beam ripped from the boy's wand, and once again the dummy's eyes showed a perfect hit. However, if you cast such a spell on a man, he'd laugh for a few seconds and then attack. But Malfoy and Nott, like Potter and Weasley, like most people in this castle, can be tortured by such curses. Something told the boy that only a juvenile bandit could think of such a use for this spell.   - Perfect again, Ilya. If you were, I don't know, ten times stronger, I'd tell you to watch out.   - Professor Flitwick says it's not about power," the boy pouted.   - He's right in his own way," Quirrell nodded. - But which do you think is more effective, a sniper rifle shot or a nuclear warhead?   Ilya smiled sneeringly, he had an answer to that question ready for a long time. Although, most likely, it was his way of trying to reassure himself.   - They're equivalent. A sniper rifle can kill the head of another country. So can a nuclear warhead.   - Except that a nuclear mushroom will wipe out a couple of million and then leave radiation behind as well.   - Unnecessary sacrifice is the ugliness of war.   - Unnecessary sacrifice is the most delusional term I have ever heard. In war, every sacrifice is worth its weight in gold. Sacrifice intimidates and therefore weakens the enemy.   - Uh," the boy mumbled. - I think it's the utterance of some crazy maniac. Well, or a psychopath who's been kicked out of his mind.   Quirrell's eyes narrowed for a moment and his right hand twitched strangely, but he immediately pulled himself together.    - You're too young, Ilya. However, would you like to show me your best shot?   - What's in it for me? - The boy was quick to react.   The professor stretched his lips in an approving grin, and then pulled a quill from his pocket. A self-writing, drunken hippogriff Ilya trampled, quill. It costs seventy galleons, not all Slytherin high school students have such thing. But it is literally indispensable for studies. Yes, with such a unit, Ilya will be able to increase the intensity of his own studies by at least one and a half times, completely eliminating all the mechanical work, which takes a lot of time!   - How's that, Mr. Top Apprentice, a worthy reward?   The boy only nodded silently, devouring the Self-Writing Pen with his eyes.   - Then I'm waiting.   - Your word?   - My word," the professor nodded.   - Deal.   The boy turned to the dummy and took a deep breath. There was only one spell he knew that didn't make him skeptical, disgusted, or feel like it was as useless as a pillow in a tank battle. As you might have guessed, it was Incendio, which the boy had spent countless hours practicing on dummies.   - Incendio!   A ten-inch stream of flame burst from the boy's wand. But the boy wasn't done with that; he concentrated on maintaining the spell, and then suddenly twisted his wrist. The jet of fire surged like an angry viper and whipped off toward the mannequin. And Ilya had already twirled his wrist as if he were circling something, and with such speed that the wand, flickering, merged into a single scarlet ball. The fiery jet spiraled, but strikingly, it didn't burn the dummy, but cut it into many pieces like a hot knife to melted butter. The boy cancelled the spell and smiled victoriously, feeling almost no fatigue. He could repeat this trick five more times and only then would he experience some kind of weakness. This spell always came to him with unexpected ease.    - How was it? - The boy asked slyly.   Professor Quirrell seemed stunned. At any rate, his eyes opened a little too wide somehow.   - Yeah," he stretched out, and then with a wave of his wand he restored the destroyed mannequin. - Was that really Incendio?   - Well, what else.   - I have to admit - you amaze me, Ilya. And to amaze me is, for some people, the goal of a lifetime.   Quirrell's not himself today. He's overheated in the sun or something.    - This is the first time I've ever seen a simple fire jet spell used as a Flaming Whip.   - A flaming lash.   At the same second, the professor silently waved his wand, out of which flew a fiery whip. It whizzed a few millimeters from the unblinking Ilya's head, and then sliced the dummy in two. A moment later the whip retracted into the wand of the wearer of the most colorful headdress.   - Well...me," the boy exhaled, staring at Quirrell and the mannequin in amazement. - Oh, I'm sorry.   - Nothing, let's just say I didn't hear anything. Your magic, Mr. Ilya, surprised me. Perhaps you are the exception, in which I acknowledge the advantages of the sniper shot.   - What's the name of this spell? - The boy's eyes lit up, his hands trembled, and he seemed to have forgotten all about his prize.   - You'll never have the strength for it," the professor shook his head.   - I won't know until I try," the boy protested. For some reason, Quirrell's hand twitched again, as if he hated being argued with. - I'm a lot better at fire spells than the sixth graders, and I can do them.   - Even so? - the teacher seemed interested.   - Yeah," the boy chucked his chin boastfully.   - Then listen - this is the spell Ignis Flagellum.    - Cool," the boy exhaled, making sure he remembered what the teacher had said, but then he pulled himself back. - Isn't that one of the Dark Magic things?   Quirrell seemed greatly disappointed.   - You don't like the Dark Arts?   - Yeah," the boy nodded. - I don't really like Zooty, either, no offense. I don't have much respect for the whole 'action' and 'black' magic thing. It disgusts me.   Again the professor's hand twitched, eyes narrowed again, but nothing happened.   - You have a rather long tongue, Mr. Ilya. It might let you down one day.   - Oh, come on. I've been told that by so many people, I've lost count. I think I'm breathing.   - You seem to have lived at St. Feredric's Orphanage in Scary Square.   - That's right," the boy nodded.   - What's it like over there now?   - Now? - The boy seized on the caveat. - Have you been there?   - I used to live there. A long time ago.   - In that case, I can assure you it's just as lousy, maybe even worse than it was. Anyway, when the Gang of Four broke up, it got really hot.   - Does Big Fatface still have his safe house on the corner of fifth?   - Nah, they cut it up about twenty years ago, it's where the Pharaohs have their hangout now.    Quirrell only hummed and froze for a moment.   - When I heard that an orphan from Scary was coming to school, I thought he would be different. Like the other person I know. But that's not what I saw in front of me at all.   - I'm sorry, it is what it is.   The professor nodded and stood up, leaving his quill on the table.   - Your reward.   - Ah, yes. Thank you, Professor!   The boy whirled to the table and carefully tucked the jewel into a separate pocket on his bag. The professor, on the other hand, diligently circled the boy in a wide arc, walked over to the lectern and sat down at his desk.   - Mr. Ilya, I give you a "P." When you leave, call the next student.   Ilya nodded and headed for the exit, but only moments later he was called out.   - Mr. Ilya, perhaps very soon, or perhaps many years from now, we will meet. And if you do not change, it is better to flee from the country.   - Uh, yes, Professor. The sun's shining today - you should come and see Madam Pomfrey.   With those words, Ilya left the room. Quirrell's in a mood today; he's probably overexposed. He's making speeches like he's out of his mind. But, thanks to his temporary insanity, Ilya gave him his quill. And with the Self-Writing Pen, the boy's gonna make a big splash. And he's gonna be in business... He also found out about a spell that could help test the boy's theory. The theory was simple - Weasel was becoming increasingly certain that fire spells were the easiest to give him, even easier than Rune.    - Longbottom, please to the firing squad," the handsome Slytherin smiled at the chubby man.   Neville nodded and ducked into his study, while Ilya, throwing his hands behind his head and whistling a jaunty tune, headed for his favorite hill. He didn't even think about the fact that Quirrell had never once stuttered today.       June 10, 1992 Hovagarts, Great Hall      Today Ilya wore his best robe. That is, the one with only three patches on it, and the collar was not sewn with an uneven stitch of capron thread. Still, the Farewell Dinner, a massive event ending the school year. Sitting at the table and devouring an impossible, unreal amount of food, making all the Slytherins cringe, the boy took stock of the year. So what had he found out in the ten months he had spent amongst the mages? The first and most important thing was that they were all, wholesale, with their own quirks. They all had one, but they all had one. Then Ilya realized that he was probably the weakest of the first-year students, but at the same time - the best student of the first year, not received a single mark below "P". A paradox, as Master Ollivander would say.    The boy also realized that if you work hard and put your heart and soul into it, the difference in magical power is quite easy to even out. Of course, the boy did not forget the positive side of the coin. The amount of kisses the Slytherin received could make any boy his age cringe with envy. He was also very annoyed that he had to go to Hogwarts, which was a good place to be, but he was also not the type to get bored. In general, Hogwarts was a cool place, a place where you didn't get bored. There is always something to do, somewhere to run, something to solve and somehow get out of hand. In short, the bosota swiveled like a louse on a comb, trying to get the best piece of everything. He had to sweat to get a good meal and a good night's sleep.   There were problems, too. Aside from the Slytherins and their hatred, the castle wasn't as safe as many liked to claim. Take Cerberus, the troll, and the most recent, outrageous incident. Imagine that - Potter flunked Professor Quirrell last week, right after his exams. Maybe he didn't like the grade. Yeah, I think he got a "P." Potter's a bit of a ZOTI dork, he can't even get a spell in his head without ordering a memorial service. You can get inferiority complexes like that. He's the one who's always been in such a bad mood. Here, Potter, inflicting justice and inflicting good, took down a terrorist in self-defense. How Weasley and Hermione, walking around the castle like World War II heroes, got mixed up in the whole story, no one knew. Perhaps they were holding the Professor's hands while the shaggy-haired bespectacled man held his judgment.    If Ilya had suspected before that Harry the Tank-Man-Potter had balls of steel, he was now sure that he also had nerves. If he got wet as a baby, and then also pissed on an adult mage when he was a freshman, then such a prick should be treated with healthy caution. I wonder why he keeps crying himself a wimp, a whiner, a dullard, and a loser. Maybe he has a split personality? Ilya's seen it before. There was a boy like that, living on the East Side, a mongrel-looking boy, but once he was kicked in the face, he changed before his very eyes, and started fighting as if for life. He used to throw everything at his adversary, and hit him with everything he could lift. He was in his third year in prison as a juvenile for triple murder. The punishment was mitigated because of his difficult childhood and negligence. They gave him seven or eight years, and appointed a psychologist. But the fact remains that not everything is as simple as it seems at first sight. We'll have to take Potter for a ride later. Not so much out of pure curiosity, though not without it, as to know what to expect from him. What if his attic finally moves into the basement, and during this wonderful move will be a nice guy Ilya. No, weasel still wants to live to take such a risk. But we'll have to check this brat out. Ilya was sure that he would do it at the first opportunity.    The feast was coming to an end, the students had almost finished their dessert. A certain melancholy heaviness hung over the hall. The Cup of the School, once again, was taken by Slytherin, to which Ilya was also credited. How many points he had brought to his department... But really, Ilya didn't care at all which house would win. Green? Fine. If the vultures had taken the cup, the kid wouldn't have cared at all either.    All in all, the year has come to an end. There were rapid ups and painful downs. Sometimes it was quite easy, and sometimes difficult and even deadly, but weasel won as always. He won, because the one who breathes wins. And Ilya was sure that he was breathing now, so everything was fine and "she" was still "spinning". And, besides, the food here is a slaughterhouse, and the beds are great. It's heaven on earth, to be quite honest.   Then the food disappeared, and the director rose from his trump stool.   (p.a. The following is a modified excerpt from the canon. The author does not claim or pass off the following text as his own work)   - So, another year behind us! - Dumbledore exclaimed cheerfully. - But before we go to bed, I'll disturb you with a bit of senile grouchiness and idle chatter. So, a difficult school year is behind us! I hope your heads are a little heavier than they were at the beginning of the year. However, you have all summer ahead of you to get your brains in order and empty them completely before the start of the next semester.   Dumbledore circled everyone present with a look of his radiant eyes.   - Now, I understand we have to determine who won the competition between the faculties. Let's start at the end. Fourth place went to Gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points. Third place went to Puffendum, they had three hundred and fifty-two points. In second place was Ravenclaw with four hundred and twenty-six points. And in first place is Slytherin with four hundred and seventy-two points.   The table where the Slytherins were seated exploded with loud shouts and applause. Ilya spotted Malfoy tapping his gold cup victoriously on the table. He averted his eyes instantly, not liking the sight. The white-haired bastard hadn't lifted a finger to help the faculty. He was just showing off his ego and getting his glasses off for being disrespectful and insulting.   - Yes, yes, you have done a fine job," Dumbledore said, turning to the Slytherin table. - However, we didn't take recent events into account.    The hall fell silent. At Malfoy's desk, smiles were no longer as cheerful. Dumbledore hummed loudly. Ilya sensed after that tray trick - there were going to be some serious fireworks.   - So," he continued. - Due to the fact that in light of recent events, some students have earned some points... Wait, wait... Uh-huh...   Dumbledore pondered - or pretended to ponder.   - Let's start with Mr. Ronald Weasley...   Weasley puffed up and looked like the ass of a gammadril in mating season.   - ...for the best chess game in Hogwarts history, I award fifty points to the Gryffindor faculty.   The screams that rose at the table where Scarlet sat must have reached the enchanted ceiling. At the very least, the stars on the ceiling trembled. Weasel could clearly hear one of the redheads, addressing the public, shouting nonstop:   - That's my brother! My little brother! He won at McGonagall's enchanted chess!   What the fuck did he win? What the hell was chess? Finally there was silence again.   - Next... Miss Hermione Granger," said Dumbledore. - For the ability to use cold logic in the face of flame, I award fifty points to the Gryffindor faculty.   Danger covered her face with her hands. The Slytherin had no doubt she was crying. Something unimaginable was going on at the Vulture table - the faculty had scored a hundred points in one minute.   - And finally, Mr. Harry Potter," announced Dumbledore, and there was absolute silence in the hall, broken only by the laughter of Ilya the Weasel. - For iron restraint and fantastic bravery, I award the Gryffindor faculty sixty points.   The noise that rose stunned Ilya. Everyone who could count and shriek at the same time had already realized that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points. That is, the same number as Slytherin. They had almost won the competition between the faculties. If Dumbledore had given the lions one more point...   Dumbledore raised his hand. The hall began to fall silent.   - Courage comes in many forms. - Dumbledore was still smiling. - You have to be brave enough to stand up to your enemy. But it takes just as much courage to stand up to your friends! And for that, I award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.   (p.a. End of excerpt)   The room exploded, pointy hats flying into the air, and everyone felt obligated to shake hands or shrug at the Golden Trio. Neville, on the other hand, slipped into a coma and began posing as Rodin's Thinker. A heavy, oppressive silence hung over the Slytherin table, and Snape looked at Dumbledore as if he were an enemy of the people. It seemed that the Halfling had been robbed of his favorite toy, the golden cup.    Green hissed in every tone, cursing whoever he could curse, but it was Malfoy who was most ravaged. He'd never heard such twists and turns before, not even on a Friday night in port when unloading a ship. It was as if Draco's cock had been ripped off, and now he was frustrated by the doom of his continued existence.    All who wore the serpent crest were in mourning, and only Illya alone, catching glances full of superiority thrown in his direction by the Golden Trio, knew that all was not so smooth. Something had escaped his tenacious gaze, something was abnormal about this Quirrell thing. Perhaps the boy, like the others, had tried to cheat and cover something up. There was a rottenness about this whole mess, the kind of rot where you're blatantly lied to, and then there was that tenner to Longbottom. No, Ilya wasn't offended by the headmaster, he still didn't care who got the trophy, but Dumbledore wouldn't give points for airy fluff. If he gave points to a puffball, then he really had a point. And this wording, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder. The smell of shit literally clouded the boy's mind. He had to, he had to think this situation through and get to the bottom of it. After all, he had all the information he'd gathered during the year. All that remained was to bring it together. Tomorrow would be the day after tomorrow because tomorrow was the last day when he could lie down on the hill and besides, the answer would be as important as another mystery. What's the rush? Really, it's not like there's going to be a war tomorrow.       June 11, 1992, Hogwarts, headmaster's office.      The boy was not allowed to lie down on the hill. His belongings were already packed, his guitar put away. A self-writing pen, three science books, a magic calculating machine, and all the boy's treasures were packed securely in magic-insulating cloth and carefully tucked away in a chest. The pouch of forty-three galleons had undergone a temporary transmutation and now rested at the bottom of the torch. Bosotic habits, if you understand, of course. So it was done, but no rest for the lad.   He was caught outside by a slightly alarmed Flitwick and led the student to the Headmaster. The boy wanted to ask what the fuss was about and convince the honest folk that he was in no way to blame, but the professor just shook his head and asked not to clown around. Surprised at the unusually serious tone, the boy fell silent and waddled along. He had all sorts of theories, but they were probably all wrong.   There were a lot of strangers in the oval office today. Three, to be exact.   - Ilya," the headmaster smiled good-naturedly, handing the boy a vase of lemon wedges. The boy nodded appreciatively and began to nibble on the treat. Still not bad. - How are you?   - I'm fine, Professor. Slowly, slowly.   - That's good.   Three strangers, two women, one a youthful, slender brunette, the other an obese, vaguely familiar, red-haired lady, and one redheaded, shouldered man, were shocked by this interaction between the student and the principal.   - Do you remember my promise? - in a calm tone, asked the silver-bearded grandfather.   - I didn't meet the terms," the boy shrugged. - He was in the middle of a conversation with me. I don't mind the hot chocolate, of course. But what's with all the faces that aren't marred by intelligence?   - Ilya," the professor continued smiling. - You're still as hard on strangers.   - I've never had time to change in a year," the boy shrugged.   - No, my boy, I mean I promised to find you a house for the summer.   The boy choked on a slice, and then Flitwick gave him a good pat on the back. He seemed to feel better.   - Thank you, Professor," the boy wheezed, turning to some part goblin. - Headmaster, what do you mean? I thought I'd make it through the summer at Tom's. It wouldn't be a bad idea to get a part-time job, either. Fortescue, for instance. I thought she was going to the Aurorats anyway, pink-haired traitor, so I could use a waiter in a cafe.   - I'm sorry to upset your plans, my boy. Here, I'd like you to meet Lithicia Melkem, who is in charge of the magical guardianship.   - Nice to meet you," the boy habitually smiled at the lady who nodded at him. - Wait a minute! What kind of custody?   - Now, I'd like you to meet these people," Dumbledore pointed to a couple of redheads. - This is Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. From now on, you'll be staying with them for the summer. They're your magical guardians.   - Mr. Ilya," Melkem said immediately. - As you understand, you have no right to refuse. It's up to the headmaster and the deputy headmaster to decide. I've already certified the papers. Conditional parental rights were transferred to the Weasleys this morning. Also, all remittances from the foundation will be transferred to their account for the purpose of improving your standard of living. Until your seventeenth birthday, the Weasleys are responsible for your welfare and life. Perhaps you should, due to the circumstances, clarify the relationship between parent and child, in this case custodian and guardian, but I think such a loving and large family can manage that on their own.    - Ilya, boy," Mrs. Weasley said with a wary smile. - Welcome to the family, and I hope you like it here.    Silence.   - Is the boy mine? - The headmaster spoke up.   Silence.   - "Ilya," Mr. Weasley called to his ward.    (p.a. I just can't put my finger on it, typing in reference to Ilya - adopted son. I think if that happened, the character would come to me in the night and nail me in the face.)   Silence.   - Mr. Ilya," the brunette from the ministry said worriedly. - Are you all right? I understand, it's not every day you get this kind of happiness.    Silence.   - Ilya," said an agitated Flitwick sternly. - Remember our conversations, don't forget about the bet, come back from the upper layers of the astral and say something already.   Slowly Ilya raised his head and sighed heavily. He stretched out the next words slowly, with an arrangement:   -Juuuuust. Fuuuuuuck. Thiiiis. Shiiiit.Chapter 10.   June 12, 1992, Scotland, Hogwarts Express.      Fields and mountains passed by the window, sometimes distant, well-kept villages were glimpsed, and even the harsh sound of klaxons could be heard. But no one seemed to notice the surprise of the speeding locomotive. The red caboose was puffing smoke out of its broad chimney in a somewhat lazy and unhurried fashion. The engineer, wand tossing in the furnace magic coal, pulled the rope and sounded long, long sound. Ilya shuddered and drew a long curved line on the diagram.   - Fuck off," Ilya hissed.    It was the third horn, which meant that they had only two hours to go, and in a moment they would be crossing the border into England. But the boy cared little for that. Actually, he should be thinking about the summer and the Weasel family, but the boy decided to put it off for a long time, literally shutting himself off from the no-nonsense problem. At the moment, though, Weasel was doing what he was going to do according to his own plan. He was pulling all the strings together. In front of him, on a notebook page of his open diary, was a long diagram with names, lines going one to the other, signs of even and various multipliers. The picture so far was a little strange, and the boy could not find the piece of the mosaic that he seemed to have missed.    There was a knock on the compartment. No, today was clearly not his day. The door slowly slid open, and on the threshold came someone he certainly wasn't expecting to see. Standing there was Potter, dressed in Muggle clothes of slightly better condition than Ilya himself. And it seems, according to the Slytherins, the Pineapple-hairs are the heir to one of the richest and oldest families. Is eccentricity coming out of his ears? There was Weasley, the heir to the poorest family, dressed in yet another hulk. And Granger, a little out of breath, still puffy around the cheeks from a year ago.   - May I? - Potter asked.   - Come in, if you're here," the boy shrugged, not caring. He had felt the doom of a suicide bomber walking the Green Mile since yesterday.   The trio of inseparable friends flopped down in front of the boy. They were now separated by a meter of space and a folding table. The redhead glanced at Ilya, then scowled and turned away, muttering something. A second later he grimaced as Danger's elbow slammed into his ribs.    - Did you want something? - He was staring at his chart again. - Or is my compartment the freest?   - We wanted to apologize," the Wet Boy replied calmly.   Ilya gasped for air, then coughed and pounded his chest violently. It seemed to ease. He looked at the Golden Trio again. Hermione and the bespectacled boy didn't look away, but Ronald was staring at the ceiling. As the Slytherin realized, the redhead knew that they would have to spend this summer, as well as the next, and many after that, under the same roof.    - If you feel like it, apologize.   - So you're not offended? - Potter wondered.   - To what? - Weasel answered the question with the same surprise.   - For accusing you of aiding and abetting Snape," the nerd said a little more quietly than she should have.   - No," the boy shook his head, drawing another line. - Besides, grudges are a girl's privilege. Guys don't get offended.   There was silence, and Ilya cursed and crossed out one of the parts of the chart. Everything went wrong again. What had he missed?   - Are you waiting for something? - Ilya asked, looking at the frozen classmates. - Oh, let me guess: you're waiting for me to apologize.   - Yes," Hermione replied calmly.   - You'll be waiting a long time," the boy shrugged again.   - But you beat Ron!   - Let's do it.   - That's not true! - The nerd wouldn't let it go. - If anything, I'm the one who accused you of being a junkie, not Ron.    The boy looked skeptically at the Gryffindors. If the version of Ilya had been here a year ago, he would have kicked them out, but talking to Flitwick had quieted his sometimes testy temper. And he was calmer about human stupidity, too.   - Beating a lady is a stingy business, not worthy of a gentleman," Ilya quoted one of his favorite literary characters. - Potter wasn't allowed either - he had glasses, and what if I killed him with that punch or took away his eyesight for life? That left Ronald. He was still trying to figure out how to get him to stare at his parents. So if you messed up, your friend messed up, which is a fair trade, don't you think?   - You're impossible! - The girl shrieked, clenching her small fists.   - Consider me a paradox," the boy hummed. - Is that it? Ron was going to throw up. He's had ninety days around a Slytherin as it is. Let the boy get some fresh air.    - Ilya, what are you drawing? - Potter's directness was killing me. He addressed everyone in the castle by their first names, except for Malfoy and Co.    - I don't draw, I draw," the boy pouted. - This is my research.   - On topic? - Hermione suddenly perked up, Ron still conversing silently with the ceiling. After all, they - both the ceiling and the redhead - were on the same intellectual level, apparently there was something to talk about.   - I'm trying to make sense of the 'truth' that Dumbledore slipped everyone. Oh, don't make those eyebrows, like Professor Flitwick says. I'm a top student for a reason.   - The best," Granger snorted dismissively.   - Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart. It's not my fault I'm a better student than you.    - You're breaking your routine and studying at night! - the girl barked. How much it hurt her that there was someone better than her.    - I don't just break the regime," the slyly grinning bosot shook his head. - I don't get caught, either. Which is more than I can say for you.   - You're impossible!   - You're repeating yourself.   - Ilya, Hermione," Potter almost pleaded. - Calm down. I'm not going to let you two fight about your grades yet.   - I need to get my hands dirty with him," the girl snorted.   - God, you literally pierced my heart," the boy aghast, putting his palm to the left side of his chest. - You trampled my self-esteem with this great insult.    - Poseur!   - And I'm not hiding it.   - Calm down, will you? - Potter shouted. Suddenly. - Ilya, what did you find out?   Ilya's eyes lit up immediately. As shrewd as he was, he was still somewhat of a braggart, without a couple of months of being a thirteen-year-old boy. He was literally bursting with a desire to trump his brains.   - Look," the boy twirled the pencil he often used instead of a quill in his fingers and began to read. - My first and most important decision was that the Philosopher's Stone was hidden at Hogwarts. I got this idea from article where it was told about Dumbledore's discovery of twelve ways of using dragon's blood. Or rather, not the article itself, but a review by his "close and precious friend, Nicholas Flamel". Flamel is a life-beaten cupcake, he apparently went on his paranoia, and asked his longtime sidekick to stash the pebble. Apparently, paranoia can be useful sometimes, too. When the Gringonts were placed on the spear, the stone was no longer there. To all appearances, not only the two old men knew that the Philosopher's Stone had been taken from the bank, but some of the bureaucrats as well. Because of the leak of documents, Quirell also found out about it. And that's where the fun begins. The professor turned out to be an old enabler of the Serpentine junta and was up to no good. He's taken up with the school, wanting to kill two birds with one stone. His first attempt to kill one of the hares was at the match - then he was plotting to take you down, Potter. But something, though I'm inclined to say someone, got in his way. And you survived. After that, the professor tempered his ardor, reasonably believing that he would now be watched. And probably someone was indeed following him, in this case I'm inclined to note that it was Snape. He does, after all, have carte blanche in the castle, everyone is afraid to look at Moushe obliquely. Next, an attempt was made to divert attention away - it seems that Quirrell brought the troll into the castle personally. How is that possible? I've heard that there are mages who can speak to various animals from birth. Snakes, cats, dogs, hippogriffs, dragons, mermaids, and so on and so forth. There's a ten-to-one chance the professor could speak Troll. Most likely, this part of the plan was a partial success. The professor knew the stone was in the Forbidden Corridor. The least that remained was to get under the cannon's ass. At first I thought the hatch was hiding a dog's dung pit, but then I realized it was a common succession of traps - a traditional trick of all magicians of the past century. Including the esteemed Dumbledore. Quirrell made several attempts to get through Cannon, but soon realized that Cerberus' hide was of the same breed as trolls and dragons. Spells would not take it. But no defense is perfect, each one has its own key. And that's where Hagrid comes into play. Quirrell got him drunk, then gave him a dragon egg, and still figured out a way to coax the beast out, though I don't know which one. Here, by the way, I take my hat off to the professor. He was apparently going to set up a delayed bomb, so to speak. When the dragon grew up, the school would be in chaos, the press would be all over the place, there'd be riots and stuff. It would've been easy enough to get the stone out. But then you guys stepped in and screwed up the villain's plan again. Then there was the incident in the woods, based on my own hunch, I'd hazard a guess that my goggle had shrunk to the point where the crazed terrorist decided to piss off a unicorn to drain his blood - here's where I got my first screwup. But moving on. After that incident, he realized that things were getting hot and it was time to force the issue. After this incident he realizes that the matter is starting to stink, and it's time to force the issue. Now here is where the real drama begins. Preachers are no idiots, and they understand a lot about people. For instance, did you know that ninety percent of mages over forty can't use ordinary Leviosa? Not because they have no powers, but because the weak and simple spells as well as the insignificant knowledge have been superseded by the cunning magic. So the professors apparently set virtually childish traps, which, if I'm not mistaken, gave Quirrell a pretty good workout. And that's where you come in. I have no idea how you figured it all out, or why you'd want to get into a dragon's jaws on your own, but the fact remains. You gentlemen ran after it. What I have here is the following picture. According to the whispers in the drawing rooms, and the smiling faces of the Lord Warders, many of them had unknowingly helped construct these traps, as a domestic project. Judging by Percy Weasley's muttering at the farewell feast, then each of the professors with an applied part of their science had set traps. I daresay the first was a trap from Sprout. I don't know, some slaughtered flower planted to gobble up everyone they could get their hands on. Next was Flitwick's spell, I think something based on that very Levios. After all, Master Char loves subtle humor. Heh. Next up was McGonagall's magic chess. Then there's supposed to be a trap from Quirell, but I don't think he was trusted, and they probably put that same troll as an obstacle. The last thing Snape did was show off. I do not know what he conjured up, but it was clearly something awe inspiring, and at the same time - proving that everyone around is stupid and can not solve the simplest problem. Snape likes to prove that he's a genius and everyone else is shit. But Quirrell apparently passed this hurdle on magic alone, but Granger really clicked the task. And finally, the final challenge, set by Dumbledore himself. And I just smell a pallet - he somehow connected the Einalege mirror to it. In fact, that mirror was the stumbling block. What happened next, I don't know. I'm sure Potter made it to the end alone, and you rabbits were left unconscious on the line. That leaves the final questions - why did Quirrell need unicorn blood and the Philosopher's Stone? What the hell did he need those things for? Wanted his own immortality? Nah, he was too crazy to be in Voldemort's service. Potter, why are those two shaking? Anyway, never mind. And here I have only one, the craziest and most maddening guess. What if the Dark Lord is alive, I know it sounds crazy, but what if that cupcake is floating around somewhere as a ghost, and Quirrell decided to resurrect his master or something like that. That's pretty much it. Did you get anywhere near the apple?   Ilya took a breath, drank water directly from the decanter and licked his dried lips. He had not made such a long speech for... ever. He always liked to speak briefly and quickly, without wasting time on demagoguery. But here he was bursting.    - Whoa, what are you hanging around for? - The boy waved his hand in front of the frozen children.   Trinity sat with glazed eyes, rolling their eyes and pursing their lips.   - Ilya, who are you? - Hermione wheezed.   It hit the kid.   - Did I do that? Did I hit the bull's-eye? - The boy laughed, astonishing those present. The boy laughed long and gleefully, and, against their will, the corners of his lips twitched. It was almost impossible not to laugh at the sound of springtime dripping. - Okay, I give you my word that I won't tell anyone anything. And Ilya appreciates his tooth. Except that the Lord is not all clear. He can't really be alive or half dead.   - Of course she can't! - Hermione shouted immediately, smiling slightly crookedly. - Quirrell had just lost his mind.    - I think so, too," the boy exhaled. - I'm sorry," he said, and then I was able to get my hands on a pen.   - A feather? - I think the kids got a little spooked.   - Yes," the boy brushed me off. - The last day, just before he died, the professor wasn't himself. He didn't even stutter.   Golden Trio shuddered, Potter went pale.   - Did you talk to him? - Pineapple Hair asked.   - Yeah," the boy nodded. - I was talking to Quirrell, what's the big deal? So, we had a little argument in the exam, and Quirrell challenged me to a wager. I beat him and as a prize the professor gave me a Self-Writing Pen.   - A self-writing pen?! - Weasley exclaimed. - It's insanely expensive.   - Exactly! - The boy cocked his index finger. - After that incident, I thought the professor had some dark shit in it. He took it to Flitwick. He spent five days on it, but the verdict was that it was a normal, high quality, self-writing pen of the latest model. Cost a hundred and forty galleons. I almost shit... the girl next to me... I almost fainted when I found out what a treasure I'd won.    - And you want to keep it? - Potter glared. - The murderer's gift?   - I don't care if it's a maniacal cannibal," Ilya snorted. - When I won the feather in a fair bet, it was mine. I don't care who the previous owner was. It's mine now, and I won't give it to anyone else.    Then Ilya decided to do what he was going to do. He was about to punch Potter in the face to see how he'd react, but he stumbled into those green eyes. No, they weren't the eyes of an assassin, just a boy, not even a yard boy. The most ordinary, naive, kid's eyes. And Ilya still remembered the eyes of the assassins who wandered into Scary Square, the way they looked right through you, the kind of piercing stare that made you want to hide from it. So did Flitwick, and Snape, and Dumbledore, and most of the professors in Hog. All of them had participated in the war and killed. And their gaze was easy to identify. But Potter... no, he had the most common stare.   - You didn't kill him," Ilya whispered on an exhale, and the trio shuddered again. A look of disbelief splashed in Granger's eyes. - Devil! Bite me something gryphon, you didn't kill him!   - What do you mean? - Potter asked, almost stuttering.   - Don't be silly! - Ilya shouted, and immediately began furiously crossing out his scheme, almost tearing up the notebook. - This is all wrong, fundamentally wrong. No, maybe the essence I have caught, but the root of the problem is not found. The devil... The devil. The devil! What kind of people are you magicians?! You're all triple-bottomed, goddamn it!   - Uh, Ilya... - I'm sure he'll be fine," he said, and then I was back to the front of the room.   - That's it! - Ilya barked suddenly, freezing in place. He pulled a couple of sheets from the notebook, tore them into small pieces, and then opened the window and threw them out. The white papers immediately disappeared from view, floating in the wind. - Play your own mysteries, intrigues, and investigations. I don't give a shit about that anymore. Sorry, Hermione," it slipped out. Whatever you want, I'm going to bed!   With those words, under the gaze of the uncomprehending Gryffindors, the boy stretched out on the sofa and closed his eyes, realizing that he had grown quite a bit this year, since his feet would soon be resting against the opposite wall.          A couple of hours later, England, King's Cross station, platform 9 and 3/4.      The train braked sharply, and Ilya sensibly bumped his head against the wall. He was about to speak out unkindly, but noticed that in the compartment were still scarlet, among which was a representative of the beautiful half of humanity. With a hiss through his teeth and a mental scolding, the boy raised himself up and waved his wand, the moment the trunk with his belongings soared over the shelf.   - Ilya!" Granger exclaimed. And when did they switch to names? - We're not allowed to use magic on vacation!   - Read the laws carefully," the boy snapped and stormed out of the compartment, the trunk flying after him.   The mood was bad. For one thing, the boy realized that he still didn't know shit about Wizard Britain, but, worst of all, summer was coming, or rather was coming, with the redheaded family. Merlin, he really should have stayed at Tom's. It would have been easier for everyone. But maybe Dumbledore was playing a joke on him. That would be in the headmaster's style, and if it was really true, Dedan would not get away with one hot chocolate. Ilya will smite him for all the slices, and then he will chew them demonstrably at every meal, and let the do-gooder burst into bitter tears, seeing as the coveted treat disappeared into the mouth of the student.   But when he saw the Weasleys on the platform, who in turn saw the Slytherin and hesitantly waved at him, Ilya realized that he was really screwed. The boy sighed heavily, gathering his will into a fist, after all he wasn't some organ from the mountain, he was Ilya the weasel, Chief White Feather, head of the defunct organization Power to Mongoose and down the list. He won't give up that easily. Straightening his back and fixing his bandana, the boy staggered down the corridor.   - What, Ilya, summer with Weasley? - Spat out Greengrass. Next to her stood Blaise, and indeed the entire, now almost sophomore, Slytherin class.   - Piss off, shaggy.   Daphne immediately turned to the mirror and then hissed, clutching her wand.   - I'm wondering," Malfoy stretched out. - What's worse, being a dirty girl or living in that barn that the Weasleys call home?   There was some sort of animated commotion behind him. Ilya turned around and saw Potter and Granger holding back Ron, who had emerged from the compartment at an inopportune time. He seemed to be about to explain to Draco the extent of the slimy slug's wrongdoing. And he intended to do so by applying his fist to the face of the hated blond. Ilya wasn't even going to get in his way, but Harry and Hermione were too griping.   - Give it a rest, huh," Weasel said tiredly. - Draco, there's no worse prospect than being you.   - Careful, Ilya," the big Nott grinned, waving his wand. - We're not at school, Snape's not around.   At these words, Ilya only dragged his trunk with a spell, which began circling between the two groups of students.   - Anybody want to meet my friend Sundowner? I assure you, he's a little rough around the edges, but still, he's a sweet guy. Just like me.   The Slytherins, as one, pulled out their wands and jabbed them in the boy's direction. From the looks in their eyes, they'd been waiting a year for this moment. They had waited to be tossed and stamped. One against eight, Ilya couldn't handle it. And don't count the Trio; Potter is the only one who can do anything, and that's only if he swings. And it'll take him a few minutes to rock, and by that time Ilya won't have any horns or legs left. Curtain, gentlemen - end of story. The summer won't be spent at Weasley's, it'll be spent at Mungo's.   - Brother George.   - Yes, Brother Fred.   Out of nowhere, the imposing figures of the Twins appeared behind the slugs, towering several heads above yesterday's sophomores.   - It seems on our colleague...   - ... Mr. Weasel, the Weasel...   - ... who gave Slytherin the Great Week of Mourning...   - ... who helped a certain Gemini infiltrate...   - ... Brother Fred!   - ... I'm sorry, Brother George, I almost said...   - ... so...   - ... Mr. Weasel...   - ... as you watch...   - ... for us to join...   - ... to your fun party?   - Whose side?   - How could you, Weasel! - One of the ginger jokers exclaimed.   - We can't leave a colleague behind... - echoed the other.   - ... in trouble! - ...in the usual manner the first one finished.   Ilya smiled; the twins had always been fine with him. And, in addition, he helped them a lot, providing them with information about Angelina and Alicia, with whom the guys were not in love. Or maybe they were, but they were clever enough to hide that fact.    - Then let's do it," the boy snorted. - We've got Best Student, Potter, Weasley, Danger, and two soon-to-be-fourth graders who are famous for their great jokes.   - We're flattered! - The twins synchronously waved their chopsticks at him.   - Do you want to bet? - Ilya smiled slyly.   The Slytherin girls wouldn't be Slytherins if they didn't figure out that this time the odds were not in their favor.    - We'll get even, Ilya," Greengrass growled.   Ilya only shrugged his shoulders. It wasn't an idle threat, of course, but the boy was sure he could get away with it, as always. He wasn't used to it. The classmates, who had also picked up their belongings with magic, flew out into the vestibule and were soon on the platform. For a while there was silence in the corridor. The twins looked intently at Ilya, the latter looked at them. There seemed to be a silent dialogue going on.   - Thank you," Ilya nodded.   - If you keep...   - ... act like a normal guy...   -... you and I have...   - ... and you have with us...   - ... there won't be a problem.   - You got it.   Fred and George nodded in sync again and headed over to Trio to help them carry the trunks. Ilya was still levitating the torch, not having any trouble with it. The boy slipped out onto the platform and walked over to the Weasley family. Molly patted him on the... bandana, not immediately realizing that his hair was hidden. Mr. Weasley squeezed his shoulder firmly and nodded. The boy did nothing, absolutely nothing. He was somewhat uncomfortable that a transfer from the fund would go to Weasley's account. He was uncomfortable about having to live surrounded by strangers and unknown people. He was uncomfortable with the fact that someone would have some kind of claim on him. He was uncomfortable having it all decided behind his back, even though according to the letter of the law. He was uncomfortable with a lot more, but he knew that in this case any aggression would only make things worse. Endure a summer with the Weasleys? Let it go. If he had to endure that too, in order to help his family in the future, then he could handle it. He just can't not handle it. It's his duty. And, as you already know, Ilya of Scary-Sketch never forgets a debt.   The laden Fred and George slipped out of the train, and were instantly embraced by their mother, who, after a few moments, began to chant to the smiling children about blown toilets and such. Who, after a few moments, began to chant to the smiling children about blown toilets and whatnot. Then there was a disgruntled Ronald, too; Ilya could understand; he didn't like the prospect of living in the same house with that gimadfly himself.   - Where is Harry? - I was wondering about the little red-haired girl who Ilya hadn't noticed at first.   The girl was sweet in her own way, but clearly not Ilya's type. He'd never liked such, how should I put it, interested ladies. The little girl's brown eyes seemed to indicate that Harry was the one she adored.    - Hey, Gene," Ronald cheered. He seemed to love his little sister. - He and Hermione went out in the back. They were more comfortable getting to their car goblins that way.   - To automobiles," Ilya corrected mechanically.   The girl immediately turned on her heels and looked at the tall boy. It annoyed Ilya. He didn't like being stared at like that, as if he were looking at a painting or a sculpture.   - I know about you," the girl said quietly. Apparently, she's so crazy about her Potter that she doesn't even blush about Ilya. Well, that's one upside. - You're Ilya. Ron wrote that you were a creepy upstart.   - Ginevra! - Mrs. Weasley exclaimed.   - And a poser," the boy winked. - And a joker and a prankster, and my nickname is Weasel.    - Ilya," the fat woman shouted at the boy.   The boy discreetly lowered the trunk onto the common cart, straightened up, and placed his left hand over his heart.   - I'm telling the truth, the truth and only the truth!   - Oh my God," the mother of the family exhaled, "twins weren't enough...   Fred and George looked at each other and gave Ilya a thumbs-up, and he winked at them. At that moment, the shoulder-length redheaded man broke through to the rather large company. Yes, the copper-haired family made Ilya himself look like, in this case, a black sheep.   - I got us a portal," Mr. Weasley said, sounding rather out of breath as he delivered it.   - Portal? - Ilya muttered.   How much he'd read about these riddles, though only in Muggle literature. So, where's the shimmering hole in space, exactly? Where are the special effects and stuff?   - Ah, Ilya, you've probably never used portals before," the impulsive missus said with a wave of her hands.   - Well, they don't exactly have a lot of portals in the orphanages," the boy said.   He got a stern look from the adults. They must have thought he was being rude or something. Yeah, it's going to be a tough summer.   - I just have that way of speaking," the boy sighed.    - We understand, but... we're having a little trouble with it.   - I don't do marshmallows either.   - Anyway," the man said in a flash, and took a long strip of wood out of his cloak pocket. - We'll all grab onto this ruler, and I'll say the special key.   - Cool," the boy nodded.   Immediately after that, preparations began. Things were dumped on a huge, flat trolley, apparently carrying metal slabs for construction work. The missus took Ginevra by the arm, then glared menacingly at the twins and at Ron, who blushed slightly. Is this some sort of ritual they have here?   - Ilya, don't you want to take your guitar off? - Mister asked.   - I'm scared," the boy shrugged, but then he came to his senses. - I mean, I'm better off with her than without her.   - Love! - The twins shouted together.   - To the grave," said Ilya.   Mrs. rolled her eyes.   - Okay, that's it," she cut me off. - Grab the ruler. I think I'm going to have to get out of here," he said.   - It's always unpleasant the first time," the boy shrugged again, but then came to his senses again when he came across people's shocked faces. - I mean, uh, well, like...   - We get it," Mister sighed heavily. - You have a way with words, but please try to filter them out a little. There are children here.   - I'm not a child! - I'm not a child." Ginevra shook her head.   - No doubt," Ilya nodded and laughed. It was amusing.    After adjusting the case, the boy looked with mild apprehension at his trunk, which held all his treasures, and then grabbed at the ruler, where there was almost no room to spare - so many hands grabbed for it.   - Get ready," Mister said sharply. - Portus Nora.   Immediately Ilya was hooked by the navel and dragged through the tube. His whole body shrank to the size of a point, and then suddenly exploded, like a rubber ball that had long before been squeezed by a steel vice. The kid fell to his knees and frantically sucked in air with his nose. But no matter how much he tried to breathe, the air seemed to flow smoothly around him. Just when the boy panicked that he was about to suffocate, Ilya realized that he had been breathing quite normally for quite some time. The world around him stopped dancing a crazy jig, and it became possible to distinguish the sky and the earth.   - Well ni... - Ilya stumbled, looking at the eyes of Mr. and Mrs., which were already starting to come out of their orbits. The children picked up their suitcases and hurried home. - I mean, the perfect way to travel. If you're a masochist, of course.   Weasel found himself standing on a small hill overlooking the valley. In the middle, between the woods and the highway rumbling in the distance, was a rather surreal house. It had once been an ordinary one-storey hut, but apparently, with the addition of the family, more and more rooms had been added to the house. As a result, the dwelling (Baron Peeves, for crying out loud) began to look like a misassembled construction set. I had an impression, that the house was about to fall apart, but it did not. Apparently, magic and some magic tricks were involved.    Next to the building there was a fairly large garden, a vegetable garden and pond, an imposing garage, and a small outbuilding, probably a barn. In principle, after the orphanage, any building without a sign saying "St. Frederick" seemed to Illychu almost a palace. So his opinion was that it was anywhere but a tsugundere or an asylum.    - Well, let's go," Mister squeezed the boy's shoulder again.   The children in front had almost reached the ornamental gate of an equally ornamental fence. I don't think it will protect them from thieves, though something told me there must be some kind of security charm or something like that on the fence.   - Mr. and Mrs. Weasley," the boy stopped the adults. - I'm going to have to warn you right away - I'm going to do magic.   - But witchcraft is forbidden during the holidays! - Mrs. grumbled. - The Ministry keeps a close eye on that.   - Ma'am, I don't know if you know this, but I'm kind of a top student. Which means I have at least some gray matter in my pumpkin. Anyway, it goes without saying that the Ministry must have gods to keep an eye on every wand individually. So they keep an eye on the terrain. And there are adult wizards living in the area. Two of them, and...   - We hear you," Mister interrupted the boy. - Maybe we ought to forbid it, but I think that would cause too much trouble. Let's make a deal-you don't tell the kids about your discovery, and you don't conjure anything dangerous.   - No problem," the kid nodded.   - Is that all or will there be more? - The man asked with a chuckle in his voice.   - For now, yes, and then as circumstances dictate.   - How businesslike," Mrs. snickered.   - Not without it," the boy shrugged and dragged his suitcase toward the building to the unceremonious laughter of the adults.   Ilya opened the gate and strode down the garden path. For a moment he thought he saw a dozen centimeter-large humanoid creatures gawking at him from the many dens, but it was probably not the brightest of portals. And why don't sci-fi writers ever write about how it sucks to burst through the cracks of the universe? Or don't they know? So it would be necessary to enlighten people not to reassure, but to chop up everything as if it were true.   As he pushed the door open, the boy staggered back slightly, then took a step back, then a step forward, back again, and then forward again. Something wasn't adding up. The room inside was three times larger than the outside. Now that's a squiggle. Flitwick had mentioned something about expanding spells, but the lad had no idea they could be cast on an entire house.    The boy found himself in the living room, combined with the kitchen. There were several large comfortable sofas, a couple of armchairs, and an impressive-sized fireplace. As the boy already knew, you could travel through fireplaces, too. Santa Clauses are nuts, snack on a dragon. Other items were a magic radio, crackling peacefully, and an old-fashioned television set that looked more like a midcentury television. A strange clock was ticking on the wall, instead of numbers there were such values as: "home", "school", "prison", "work", "travel", "lost", "hospital", "prison", "danger of death", and there were nine hands and all with pictures of family members. In the kitchen, by the way, ladles were flying, and knives were banging against the boards. Ilya whistled - these were advanced household charms, you need to have a certain ability for such things. True, the lad himself had no intention of ever learning the next level. After all, if the boiling spells were somehow useful to the man, then a knife masquerading as a board cutter was a waste of time. Sure, you'll say that if a knife can cut bread, so can a man. But the trick is that by applying a household spell, you'll make the knife cut exactly bread and nothing else. For bread, you need another one, for meat another one, and so on. And for cutting a person, you need Dark Magic. So it's not that simple.   - Come on," Mister called out to the boy. - I'll show you your room.   - Am I going to have my own room? - Ilya wondered.   The head of the redheaded family was a little embarrassed.   - You and Ron don't get along very well," he cut the corners with a neat little twist. He was almost having an armed conflict, not "don't get along. - And we didn't think it was a good idea to put you two in the same room. But... it's not really a room. Come on, though, you'll see.   Mister tried to take the lad's trunk, but he did not consider himself a pampered infirmity and sharply withdrew, showing that he could manage on his own. The two men climbed the creaking stairs, and the lad counted six rooms in all. One of them was on the first floor. It was covered in strange red lettering and had "Ginny," written across it in big letters. There were three bedrooms on the second floor. One said "Do not enter without knocking. Percy," another was "Parents," and the third was "Ron." There was a third floor, with only two rooms, one evidently abandoned, with a heavy barn lock and no inscription. The second was painted in an eye-popping color. The writing was glowing scarlet and read: "Dread and Forge. Come in, don't be afraid."   - What's the...   - That's where Bill used to live," the man said immediately. - He's our oldest son, and he works at Gringonts as a curse breaker.   Ilya whistled. And this Bill is no shyster. A curse breaker is like the Indiana Jones of the magical world.   - When he left, he put a lock on the room and asked no one to go in there. And you know you don't want to find out what a wizard like Bill had left at home. I'd have to hope it wasn't anything dangerous.   - Didn't you ask?   - Asked, of course. But he doesn't say anything. And no one wants to quarrel too much. We're here, by the way.   The boy turned his head, but saw nothing but a dead end. Then Mister raised his hand and pulled the rope. Immediately a long ladder went down, leading to the attic. Ilya went up first and was pleasantly surprised. It was a small room with oblique walls. A tufted carpet with a picture of a sleeping wolf was laying on the floor. A huge window looked out over the woods, and from it one could climb straight out onto the wall. There was an old empty wardrobe in the room, a neatly nailed to the wall shelf with a cracked lacquer. A small desk, not blocking the path to the window, and a bed made up. Yes, it was cramped even more than the Gryffindor dormitory, and certainly less space than the Berloga, and yet it was okay. After all, for the first time in his life, Ilya had his own corner.    - There used to be a ghoul living here.   - Yes," the boy nodded, sucking in a nose that was now almost weathered with an unpleasant odor similar to that of potions and ghosts. - I can smell it.   - Can you feel it? It doesn't matter, though. Well, here's the thing. We kicked the ghoul out, and we redecorated a few things around here. But if you don't like it, we'll call Bill tomorrow and have him open his cave.   - Oh, no, no, no," the boy shook his head. - I'm willing to stay here for one window.   Mister smiled and squeezed his shoulder again.   - Professor Dumbledore and Professor Flitwick said so - "Ilya will stay because of the window."   - Were they here? - the boy wondered.   - Of course they did. Honestly, they're the ones who set this place up.   - Here's the bugs," the boy muttered.   - Ilya, you shouldn't talk about adults like that," Mister shook his head. - I hope you're not offended by them.   - No," the boy brushed me off. - No," the boy brushed me off. It's a shame they didn't ask my opinion, of course. But I guess they wanted it to be a nice surprise. But I'll show them again, of course. I think Flitwick will survive six months without his chewing feathers, and Dumbledore without his lemon wedges.   - You're very crafty, Ilya," Mister continued to smile. - Well, you get yourself settled and come down and we'll have lunch.   The redheaded man lifted the manhole cover and climbed down the sliding ladder, which then retracted back. The boy sat down on the window sill and looked out at the forest swaying in the distance, as if breathing and alive. It might not be an easy ninety days at all, but he had no right to fail. Ilya would endure, for he was Ilya, the leader of the youngest Skary Square gang, and therefore doomed to win. Chapter 11.   (In memory of Shute, who proved that Russian rock is complete crap, but still pressed the pedal to the floor until the very end).             June 26, 1992, Agglia, near Ottery St. Catchpole      An old owl, even a bald one in some places, was knocking excitedly at the window. He lifted his head from the table and squinted at the light streaming in through the curtains. How long had he been awake? Three, maybe four days? Yeah, probably that long. The boy snapped his fingers and the quill dived into the inkwell and finished writing down the equation. Probably shouldn't have tried to calculate the direction vector given Ornis's law, maybe I should have applied Gripis's formula and... Oh, no, I have to stop.   Ilya, wobbling, got up from the table and opened the window. Immediately an owl almost crawled into the room. It, breathing heavily, put an envelope on the table. Who's that writing letters? What, the Gringonts' coat of arms? Ah yes, Weasel sent two galleons to the bank yesterday, asking that they be exchanged for pounds. Minus costs and everything, he got four hundred and fifteen Muggle money.    - Fly on," the boy wheezed.   The owl hissed and hissed.   - Fly, I say, you have nothing to eat.   The boy was painfully pecked and boxed and flew out into the street, before he hit the glass and almost shattered it. Ilya watched the scene with complete indifference, and then turned back to the bed. He looked at the unfinished calculation, then back at the bed, and finally flopped down on the mattress. Ilya pulled up the blanket, curling up like a little baby, and a moment later he was snoozing sweetly.            June 27, 1992 England, near Ottery St. Catchpole           Ilya came out of the pond, stomped along the wooden deck, which had been built with only a hammer, nails, and a couple of worn calluses, then wiped himself dry and got dressed. You've probably guessed by now why the lad bathes in the pond in the mornings and evenings. If not, imagine how hard it is to get in the shower when there are almost six people living in the house. It's not just difficult, it's, devil, practically impossible. Especially considering that little Rani, a baby in every sense, if you understand, likes to hang out in the bathroom for forty minutes at a time. Waiting to grow up or something? Or is he practicing some kind of special spell? But that's not the point.    Ilya, who got up at Hogwarts at half past seven every day, was up at Nora at the same time, but here was the surprise. They didn't start serving water until after eight in the morning. That's ridiculous. The boy had asked Mr. and Mrs. what that was about, but no one had been able to explain it properly. They probably didn't know themselves.   He put on his underpants, shorts, and T-shirt and walked barefoot back to his room. I don't mean barefoot. He jumped onto a barrel, pushed off it and hung on the ledge, pulled himself up, then ran up the drainpipe and crawled up it like a cockroach. Then, with my fingers and forearm muscles I got on a minus slope, threw over my leg and got on the roof in front of my window. After such a master class in domestics, the boy jumped onto the tufted carpet and flew up to the bed.   Ilya grabbed his bag and tossed in his old, cracked black leather purse, now full of crisp bills. After that he put on his last pair of sneakers, one of three - one was shredded, and the other was missing somewhere. Finished dressing, the boy looked around his room with a nagging glance. Little had changed in more than two weeks. Except for the bookshelves that had been there, and the school uniform and gown hanging in the closet. He always put everything else of value in the trunk. Not that he didn't trust Weasley, which was fine, of course he didn't. Which was why, before he left, Ilya pulled out a wooden plank. He placed it against the chest in which all the treasures were stowed and cast the spell of Eternal Bonding on it. Weasel then took out a jar of a special ink solution and marked a small lock rune on it. For a moment the pattern on the die glowed a steady scarlet color, then disappeared. Sometimes it was good to learn the runes. The minor ones could be used instead of the simplest of charms, and the older ones could be woven into spells. Any enchantments and curses, studied from the fifth year, had in their composition not some usual strokes, but the drawings of the Elder Runes. That's why Dumbledore wrote that Numerology without Runes was Sisyphean labor. The composition of a spell involves both spheres of knowledge.   Ilya put the jar away, then lifted the hatch and glued a note to its outer side - "Gone, I'll be there tonight. Then he took a lump of plasticine out of the desk drawer, stuck his hair in it, and smeared it diligently over the gap between the floor and the hatch. No, Mister and Mrs. themselves did not arouse suspicion, in principle normal peeps, with their own cockroaches, though. Everyone was trying to explain to Illya how bad Slytherin was and how good Gryffindor was, and they couldn't understand why the boy couldn't care less about departmental differences. But the Twins, Ron and Gin, were causing a healthy amount of apprehension. The twins because they could pull pranks at the wrong time, not that Ilya couldn't laugh at himself, but sometimes Dread and Forge annoyed him with their inexhaustible supply of shills in one place. Ginny had come to regard the handsome boy as her rival in everything. She demonstrably ate faster than he did, washed the dishes more thoroughly and just as quickly, if Ilya said something, she was sure to argue, if he went for a run, Gin ran ahead, and so on. Anyway, for some reason the younger redhead had gotten it into her head that Ilya wanted to outshine Potter, and Ilya, according to Jean, wasn't worth a fingernail of that very Potter. So she's just a groupie.   Most annoying of all was Ronald. The little asshole was always doing something naughty. He behaved quietly in public and didn't even pay attention to his new roommate, but he could do something nasty on the sly. And how this contagion did not get to Slytherin, only a hat knows. At first Ilya contemplated revenge, but then he gave up. The redhead wasn't worth the precious time.   Throwing the bag on his shoulder, the boy jumped out onto the roof, closing the window behind him. Ilya scooped the moisture that had accumulated overnight from the shingles, splashed it on the sash windows, and then cast a frost spell in a flash. The wood was covered in frost in a blink of an eye. He didn't have the strength for a real frost. But it would have to do, because if someone opened the window, the kid would know about it.   Jumping to the ground and removing the inertia of the fall with a roll, the lad jogged towards the highway. Ilya ran across a wide field lined with tall, swaying in the wind, jumped over a deep creek, and reached the artificial embankment on which the four-lane highway was located. It was not a busy road, but cars were rare guests here. The English roads, famous for their quality, were in need of repair. Some stretches had tiny cracks and bumps in them. They should have written the measure, or who was in charge here.    Ilya wanted to raise his thumb, but didn't notice that he was clutching a wand in his hand. There was a sharp, ear-piercing screech of brakes, and right out of thin air materialized a large double-decker bus. The bus was gray, and had been through a lot of trouble. Its wings were laden with dirt, its windows steamed up, and the left mirror was all but torn off. With a heavy metallic creak, the front door opened and a tall guy with disheveled hair appeared on the steps.   - Welcome to the Night Knight, transport for wizards in distress," the conductor said in a bored tone. - My name is Stan Shanpike - I'm the conductor. Are you in trouble?   - I don't think so.   - You're in big luck, there's a special offer today for those not in trouble - gift-wrapped snuffle compost. Do you need snuffle compost?   - I think not, - Ilya is still in cognitive dissonance and is still trying to adjust the paradigm of being in a new way.    - Then come aboard.   The boy nodded belatedly and climbed the steps. He found himself in the cabin, among the seats and the wizards sleeping on them. It looked more like the cabin of a second-rate airplane than a bus. I'm sure wizards do a lot of things to make life difficult for themselves.    - Where are you going? - asked the bored guy   - In Ottery.   - So close... - exhaled a frustrated codger. - That'll be three quid.   - Do you take pounds?   - And these papers... That'll be half a pound.   Ilya silently handed out the necessary amount of money, which was pennies, because Ilya doubted that he would get change here.   - Ernie! - Stan turned to the cabin and shrieked in rage. - Mermaid up your ass, drown it to Otterie!   The door closed with a creak, and Ilya sensed something wrong with the pallet. And the second the doors closed, the bus went into hyperspace. The guy was abruptly thrown backwards into the seat which had deftly picked him up, with unreal force the young man was pressed into the back of the seat, he could not even breathe normally. The landscape beyond the window merged into a single strip of crazy coloring, and the rare cars on the highway the bus did not even try to overtake. It was as if it was passing over them, giving the impression that some kind of springs were detached from the suspension, lifting the unit above the wheels. That's just madness. What mad genius invented this mind-boggling artifact? No sooner had Ilya had time to think over the idea, than he was sharply thrown forward. The boy was saved only that the case snagged on some pillar, which saved Weasel from a painful fall.   - Ottery," Sten announced.   Ilya, still in shock, went outside, and when he turned around, the bus was gone. They had covered almost fifty kilometers in just a few moments. This, what a blatant violation of all the laws of physics and other things in general. The bus, rushing at supersonic speeds, yeah, magic can do a lot of things.   He checked his case, but found no scratches or other damage on it, which was good. The boy himself was standing near a pole with an aluminum sign. On it was already known to us the name and the number of the population. At the moment there were one thousand four hundred and thirty-three people living in the small town.    Ilya, without thinking long, walked along the side of the road, slowly approaching the village. In fact, Ottery St. Catchpole, was an ordinary English town. Here you wouldn't find rickety wooden houses, a sandy road, wilted gardens and run-down vegetable gardens. No, no, no. There are only neat, well-kept, stylized cottages with garages, fine gardens, and if there was a vegetable garden, it is sure to be in a greenhouse. The main road leading to the village is covered with high quality asphalt, and in the town itself, near the central square, it is as if lined with cobblestones. This is done in order not to smoke near the City Hall, and in general - the center of such towns, it is a concentration of life. There you will find a local bar and an administrative building, opposite the "hut" of the pharaohs and the local cinema. There are no shops in the centre; they are on a special street. A street that is not called a shopping street, but it is. There you may find one of the now popular chain hypermarkets, but most probably you will only see small shops. which are like a throwback to years gone by. You will not be able to buy bread and meat under one roof. You'll most likely have to cross the road and haggle over life with another shop assistant, and to buy clothes you'll have to walk down the road and flirt with a high-school summer intern. If you're from the city, she's bound to tell you how bored she is here and how she wants to get away and be a pop diva or other media personality for sure.    Of course, Ilya could not count on flirting. Yes, he was tall for his age, and six months of training did make him look a little older. Without looking at the typical features of a teenager of almost thirteen, he could be fourteen, or, with a big, very big stretch, fifteen, but no more.    Wandering the streets, enjoying the usual conversations that made no mention of Quidditch, dragons, lords, Potters, etc., the boy walked unnoticed to the shoe store. Weren't you warned? There is nothing, I repeat, nothing you can buy under one roof in England-township.    The bell rang, and he found himself in a spacious room filled with boxes holding everything from shoes to boots to sneakers. From shoes to boots, from moccasins to sneakers.    - Good afternoon," smiled a girl of about eighteen who had slipped out from behind the counter.    She was dressed in tight jeans and a short pink top that emphasized all the smooth curves. Ilya felt a tugging sensation just below her waist, his heart beat a little faster, and his eyes went to the dcolletage, where the satiny skin glistened with an inviting cleavage. It was something new.   - I'd like a few pairs of sturdy sneakers.   - We'll be right there," the girl smiled. - He's such a good-looking guy, he needs the most amazing sneakers.   - You tell me," the boy shrugged.   Still, she treated him like a child, well, he was essentially one. In half an hour Ilya tried on about ten different pairs. Some didn't like the soles too hard or too soft. In others, the instep stung, or was quite loose. The lacing was too close to his forefoot, or there was glue put in the rings under the laces instead of being riveted firmly. In the end, the boy chose what he thought were the most resilient sneakers, which satisfied him. He donned one pair immediately, feeling the desired lightness in his legs. He hid the others in his over-sized duffel bag. As always, thanks to Flitwick for that.   - They say that the better a man knows about shoes, the better he understands women, - she winked at him, probably intending to embarrass him.   The boy gave the girl an examining look, then adjusted his bandanna, releasing a strand on his left side, smiled one of his smiles, and winked a crooked wink. The lady's eyes suddenly sparkled sharply, her lips opened slightly, and a slight, barely noticeable blush flooded her cheeks. Satisfied with his joke, Ilya put the money on the counter and walked away. After a year of squeezing, cuddling, and other things, he was no longer embarrassed by anything. Even before it took a lot of effort and imagination to embarrass him.    The next item on the imaginary itinerary was a clothing store. Ilya calmly crossed the road and found himself in the right shop. Here he was met by a hospitable old lady with slightly tired, but happy eyes. She took a quick glance at him and smiled a little hazy.   - Hello," she said quietly.   - Good afternoon.   - Are you visiting your grandparents for the summer? - the saleswoman asked. Without another word, she began to choose various shirts, shorts, shirts and jeans.   - Yes," Ilya nodded.   - Did you leave your suitcase at home? - She asked, with a touch of slyness in her voice.   - Yes," the young wizard repeated.   The old woman shook her head and put the clothes on the counter. Ilya began to look at the goods again. He had little interest in style, color, or anything else. The main thing for the barefoot were: the strength of the seam, the quality of the material, the tensile strength and friction. As a result, he rejected about three shirts, which clearly would not last a couple of months, a few jeans, too flabby in the groin area, if you run a lot - there would be trouble, chafing. He examined his shirts critically around the sleeve seams and collar. The most dangerous places. They were torn or frayed all the time. After twenty minutes, after several trials, Ilya took himself "only" - three shirts, two T-shirts, three pairs of jeans, five pairs of breeches, one pair of shorts, a new jumper, and five shirts. For everything else, I had to shell out a hundred and twenty pounds. A real bust.    The old woman took the banknotes and started twirling them round and round.    - Not stolen? - she seemed a little surprised.   - Ma'am, I...   - Don't worry, boy. I've seen a lot of people like you in my time. The cops are on patrol from ten to four, so try to stay out of sight.    - Yes, ma'am.   - Thanks for the purchase, come back again.   The boy went outside. The shopping trip had taken him a little over an hour and there was still plenty of time before the evening when the Pharaohs began to disperse. Things were safely tucked away in his bag, and his wallet was still full of cash. Muggle pounds weren't likely to be needed by the lad in Hovgarts, but he didn't want to squander the capital.    Slowly wandering down the street, looking at the happy faces of passersby, Ilya wondered what he could do. He looked at a cafe with a red sign on the corner of the street. From there he could hear the clinking of dishes, loud conversations and soft laughter. He was not hungry, so he continued on his way.   The weather was fine, there was a light northern breeze, so that the scorching June sun was not felt. There were not too many people, but he constantly caught curious glances. Apparently, everyone knew everyone here, one way or another. So they were surprised at such a newcomer. Sometimes Ilya cringed when they looked at him again, but it wasn't because he was too shy, just because he didn't know who was the Pharaoh and who wasn't. It was unlikely that the custodians of the law, would wear a uniform at one o'clock in the afternoon.    Suddenly the boy froze. His eyes met the poster of the local cinema, a two-storey gray building. There was a booth at the entrance, where a bored boy of about sixteen was sitting, punching out paper tickets for families with screaming children. On the wall, in an iron frame, behind glass, hung a poster on which a colorfully drawn monster was dancing with a beautiful girl.   - "Beauty and the Beast," Ilya read.   The boy knew immediately where he wanted to go. Of course, he had been to the movies, but he had never seen a movie there, because by and large he and his friends either hid or slept in the buildings of cinemas. After fixing his bandana, he went to the cashier's desk.   - I'd like one ticket, please," he asked.   - To a cartoon? - the boy asked with a chuckle. Apparently he thought that cartoons were only for children. Well, maybe he had a point. But adults are, after all, children too, just in disguise.   - Yeah.   - You owe me a pound, then.   Ilya handed the cashier a gold coin. He quickly tossed it into the cash register, then pulled one ticket from a long ribbon.    - Tenth row, fifth seat," the part-time senior mockingly stretched out. - The show's in ten minutes.   Ilya just nodded, took the white ticket and went inside. He passed the revolving door and found himself in a spacious hall. There was a bar on the left side, except that they didn't sell drinks but various chocolate bars, hot chocolate, coffee, popcorn, a machine for milkshakes and cotton candy. The boy looked to the opposite side, where people were already being let in through the open doors. Ilya would never admit it to himself, but he'd always wanted to crunch the chowder while sitting in a movie. So, literally on autopilot, he made his way to the counter, where he was met by another young girl. Apparently, Ottery's teens preferred to spend the summer working. In fact, so did most European and American teenagers.    - I'll have some popcorn, please.   - Big, small, or medium? - smiled at the lady with the brown hair and dimples on her cheeks.    - Let's have a big one," Ilya answered after thinking for a while.   - Sweet, salty?   - Salty.   The girl, smiling, poured him into a cardboard, huge glass, white, with brown streaks, popcorn and placing it next to the cash register, said:   - Two pounds.   Two more coins left the boy's purse. After taking the order and winking at the lady, he hurried to the hall. There he was met by another schoolgirl, who asked him for a ticket in a stern tone. On receiving it, she pointed out to the boy which way to go. It seems that Illyipov was lucky, he was sitting in the center row, in the center seat. The best seat in the hall. Past the noisy children who were rubbing their mothers, past the obviously bored dads busy rummaging through their diaries or reading flyers, Weasel sat down in the recliner. He set his guitar case in front of him and rested a huge glass on his knee. Soon the light in the hall went out, the projector noise was heard and the picture appeared on the screen. The boy held his breath, his hand reached for the air-corn.   - Young man, would you mind not crunching? - hissed the man sitting next to him.    Ilya looked around and saw that in the immediate surroundings, he was the only one with popcorn.   - I couldn't," he cut off.   The man, encouraged by his wife, for some time sputtered on the subject of rude and rude youth, but Ilya did not listen to him. The young wizard was completely absorbed in the movie.      * * *       The show went on for about an hour and a half, and weasel didn't even have time to realize when the show was over. Just at some point the story ended, the lights went on and we had to leave. Ilya, leaving the hall, felt strange. This simple and unpretentious adaptation of an ancient as the world fairy tale, completely captivated him. There were amazing colors, laughter and wonderful music. But what struck the kid the most was Belle. After all, if there was a girl in the world, albeit an imaginary one, who could love, despite her fangs, horns, fur and tail. Then maybe, somewhere, at least somewhere, there would be one that would be interested in Ilya not as a plush toy or as a blue-eyed beauty, but just as Ilya, the magician from Skary Square.    On leaving the cinema, the lad stood in the street for a while, and then turned around a hundred and eighty. He approached the cashier again, and to the vile laughter of the pimply boy, said   - I'd like one ticket to the cartoon.   - Didn't you sleep through the whole thing? - The young man in the booth sniggered. - Give me a pound.   Again Ilya bid farewell to the ringing coin.    - You're in luck. Same place, same row.   Getting a ticket, Ilya rushed inside.      * * *       Not once, not twice, and not even three more times, Ilya bought a ticket and popcorn and rushed to the hall. Always in the same seat, in the same row. And each time he waited for the music to play, the girl to sing and, funnily enough, the teapot. There was only one movie going on in the small cinema today - the premiere. The cartoon was playing all the time, and each time the hall was full of people. But Ilya did not care, nor did the laughter of the cashier, the saleswoman at the counter and the checker at the entrance. He just walked into the hall, sat in a chair, and immersed himself in something unreal, far more magical than Hogwarts with its witchcraft.    And yet, the last session was over and I had to leave the place. The city clock showed half past midnight, and the street had long been wrapped in a dark shroud, barely penetrated by the light of the streetlights. Ilya, grabbing his case and fixing his bag, staggered down the street toward the highway. The lights were on in the houses, and he could see vague silhouettes sitting around them. Every once in a while some laughing girl's scream, a dog barking, or a klaxon squealing could be heard in the distance. The boy liked these nocturnal sounds, they were more familiar to him than the stomp of feet on living stairs, the rustling of robes against the ancient stone floor, or the creaking of feathers.    Ilya turned the corner, and began to walk down the slope. On one of the fences sat fluffy black cat, he lazily opened his right eye and peered at the boy, walking on the street. Tail suddenly yawned and meow long. Ilya laughed and meowed back. The cat looked at the man as if he were mentally ill, snorted and jumped down, hiding in the yard. The boy threw his hands behind his head and mockingly stamped his step and began whistling one of any number of tunes by the immortal Bob Marley.    - Little man," he called out from behind him.   The boy turned and inwardly gathered himself. From behind the bend appeared two pharaohs with flashlights and in blue uniforms.   - Young man, what are you doing outside without your parents after curfew.   Ilya almost slammed his hand on his forehead. For minors in most European countries, including Britain, there is a strict law. After ten o'clock - not a step out of the house without a responsible person. It's supposed to reduce juvenile delinquency. Well, well. Tell that to the people of Skary Square, indeed the whole of London. They're still running from the police.   - I'm from the hospital," the boy said abruptly. - I was visiting my grandmother. She's not well.    - What's the grandmother's name? - The cop came up and asked.    The pharaohs looked as if they had come off the screen of a comedy. One was as tall and thin as a reed, and the other was as short and fat as a beer keg.   - Maria, uh, Rosa Maria.   - Rosa Maria you say. Terry, have you ever heard of an old lady with that name coming into the hospital.   - No. To be honest, I've never heard of it. And I've lived here since birth.   Pharaohs came very close and shined a flashlight in the wizard's face. He blinked and covered himself with his hand.   - Hey, kid," said the fat one. - This is the first time I've seen you, too.   - Young man, come with us.   - "Gotcha," Ilya sighed mentally, and said aloud. - Good.   The cops got sloppy. For nothing. At the same moment, the boy kicked the skinny one under the knee with all his might. Pharaoh howled a lame dog and jumped on one leg, soon collapsing to his knees. The fat one drew his club, but he was almost as tall as Ilya. That's why the boy, not confused, in Chuck Norris style, kicked him from the U-turn. It was a good one. Pharaoh was battered into the fence like a battering ram. It was probably due to the acceleration and inertia, plus the weight of the guitar, hanging over his shoulder.   At the same instant the boy sprang from his seat and raced down the street. He ran and couldn't contain his laughter, remembering how dashingly he'd done the Pharaohs. And that chopper... They wouldn't believe anything he told them. Ilya, rather instinctively, and one reflex, looped through the streets, turning in the narrowest and tightest alleys, he avoided the lights, and sneaked among the fences. He ran behind slithering cars, and at times he froze around the corner of a tall house. But no matter how many times he turned around and waited and looked, no cops or their cars ever showed themselves. Either the cops could not come to their senses, or the villagers, by and large, did not care for such zealous "criminals".   The weasel stopped only at the highway, leaving behind a post with the name of the town and the number of inhabitants. The boy looked at the wand tucked behind his belt, then at the forest, and then back at the wand. Yes, he could, of course, call out that Night Knight again and get to Nora in a few moments, but that would be... boring. Yeah, yeah, boring and uninteresting. Traversing the forest at night, fighting his way to his destination, on the other hand, was exciting. In the boy awoke, as it is called by the old adventurers - "the spirit of the hunt". Ilya was not afraid to dive into the bushes, fixing the bandana.    The night forest did not frighten the boy at all. It was bright enough, thanks to the bright moon and the stars blazing with an indifferent flame. Ilya walked along the path, as he somehow thought it led to the valley where the magic house stood. Ilya was not afraid of far away, misty rustles that dangerously tickle the ears, and was not afraid of cracking twigs nearby, whooshing owls and distant, ghostly wolf song. He just walked, whistling a melody about three birds that flew to the threshold in the morning and that all problems will disappear one day and therefore he should not be sad.    At some point, Ilya stopped noticing the time, just wandering along the path, sometimes jumping over ravines, or some tall snags. But it had been a rather busy day, and soon the boy began to fall asleep. You might think weasel had gone mad, but I assure you, not yet. And yet the lad, as if he did not notice that he was in a dense thicket, just leaned against a tree, put a case in front of him, hugged it with his arms and closed his eyes. Sleep overtook him instantly, taking him into a world where in the darkest castles, live the most beautiful fairy tales.       June 28, 1992, Anlija, the forest near Otteri.       Ilya woke up, and at first thought he had fallen asleep in some coat shop. He was lying with his head on some brown, warm fur, covered by a gray, hot blanket, and everywhere he looked there was that same wool. Ilya shook his mane, noticing that the bandanna had made an escape attempt during the night, but never managed to get too far. The boy wrapped the cloth around his head, leaving a peculiar tail of wavy hair at the back. For a while after this ritual, the boy was in a stupor. For a while after this ritual, the boy was in a daze, until the whole clearing, where the wizard had spent the night, began to resound with prolonged yawns.   Blanket suddenly rose from Ilya, licked his nose, and began circling around, stretching and twirling his tail. Pillow, deafening with his roar, rose on his hind legs and began to scratch a nearby tree with his long claws. Here and there flashed some white, gray and yellow shadows. Ilya nearly fainted when he realized that he was sleeping on the back of a brown bear, covered him a gray wolf, and around lay a dozen other animals. There were other wolves and wolf cubs, hares, foxes and foxes, cubs, two wolverines, one lynx and two leopards, in the distance, at the very edge, a deer with a deer and even a moose.   Probably any normal person would have been at least a little scared, but not Ilya. He didn't even understand why he thought he had to be afraid. Suddenly, a small bear cub climbed onto the boy's lap, like a small child, stretching its paws to the boy's face. Ilya took the cub in his arms and gave it a twirl. The bear cub roared happily, while the big pillow-bear looked on with a completely calm gaze. He probably shouldn't have done that, though, because a moment later he was inundated with a wave of furry cubs, bears, rabbits, foxes, and other furry creatures. They were all biting the boy lightly, pulling on his pants, ears, shirt, and licking at his nose and cheeks.    Ilya, laughing, tried to brush them off, and then grabbed a case and started running from the pack. Soon the older generation joined the game. They scurried around the wizard, sometimes pushing him, rubbing against his legs or arms. Anyway, after literally ten minutes, he was still flung to the ground and sunk into the warm fur. The guy was laughing and kicking, trying to get out. No one knows how much time passed over the game, but at some point, Ilya, as if he had woken up out of the fog, remembered that he had to go back.   - I have to go," he said.   The animals stopped fidgeting and looked sadly at the boy. The wolf cub approached, its nose pressed into the palm of the boy's hand. The bear cub fell off Ilya's shoulder, approached its mother bear and sadly roared.    - But if that's what you want, I'll come again," Ilya smiled.   The beasts began to shriek, bark, growl, roar, moo, and gallop around joyfully. The lad straightened his case, picked it up, and turned toward Nora. No sooner had he taken a step than a stag with royal, branchy antlers stood in front of him at its ginormous height.   - You want to take me for a ride? - surprised the boy.   The deer still stood still.   - ?... in a race," the boy stretched out.   Weasel, not even realizing that he could not overpower the animal on the run, suddenly took off. There was rumbling behind him, and soon the ungulate rushed after him, and with him the whole horde. The boy, without even feeling it, rushed along the path like the wind. At times he literally flew over wide streams, deep ravines and high stumps. Animals were running next to him but lagging behind. Foxes were competing with wolves in speed, deer with elks, bears were puffing somewhere behind, complaining that such speed they were not able to. Indifferent wolverines stayed on the glade under taunts of birds. Bobcats, like shadows, flashed among the trees, occasionally frightening herbivores, and leopards, spreading their long tails, sometimes jumped over the wolves, demonstrating their natural impudence.    And the boy kept flying, laughing, just as he had once in the Magic Forest. He hadn't noticed everything that was going on around him, but after an indefinable length of time, the valley appeared through the clearing, and Nora was standing in the middle of it. Ilya froze and looked around. There was a deer standing nearby, the only one who had kept up with the child.   The wielder of the most colorful hair, walked up to the kid and leaned over, poking his muzzle into the boy's forehead.    - Tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be here," the boy whispered, rubbing the beast's neck.   With these words, the boy turned and, without looking back, walked towards Nora.      * * *       Ilya creaked through the front door into the living room and froze. They looked at him as if he'd been raised from the dead by Merlin. That is, with their eyes bulging and their mouths open. The most surprising thing was that not only the entire Weasley family was in the house, but also the headmaster and, for some part, the goblin.   - What kind of rally? - the boy asked.   - Ilya!" exclaimed the missus.   With abnormal speed for her build, the mother of the family jumped up from the couch, ran up to the boy and tried to put him in her famous, Hagrid embrace. Ilya dodged.   - You'll remember the guitar," the boy muttered, hiding behind the sideboard.   - Mr. Ilya," the ma'am suddenly turned serious, like a weather vane. - Try to explain to us where you've been all this time.   - Is this the time? - The boy still didn't understand what they wanted him to do.   - You've been gone all day and all night!    - Well, I went for a walk. I think I even left a note," Ilya shrugged, still looking at the professors uncomfortably.    - Walking?! - The missus roared like a wounded bison.   - Molly," Dumbledore's voice was one of those that cooled the mood that had already begun to heat up. - Ilya, aren't you going to tell us why you ran away.   - Escaped? - the guy was still flying around in the astral. - I was still flying around in the astral realm. I wandered through the stalls, then decided to go straight through the woods, but I got tired and dozed off.   - Dozed off? - the director was surprised. - In the woods?   - No, in the morgue. Rejoice and take heed - I have risen and returned to do my work.   - Mr. Ilya," Flitwick chuckled. - You're too excited.   Yes, when Ilya was worried, he always switched to the manner of speech of a shelter bandit.    - Ilya," Mister voiced, showing his fist to the almost openly laughing Twins. Ginny and Ronald were sitting next to them, looking at Ilya with eyes full of contempt and disgust. Percy had run off somewhere. He must have gone off to study. - Ilya, you must understand how worried we were about you. We've been looking for you all evening and most of the night. We were about to call the Aurors!   - Why are the professors here then? - Weasel asked.   - Ilya," the director sighed heavily. - We thought...   - That I would run off to London to see my friends," Ilya finished.   - Ilya!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. together. - What do you think you're doing?! How dare you interrupt the principal!   - Molly, Arthur, this is unnecessary," the Daedan said calmly. - Yes, Ilya, that's exactly what we feared.   - Professor," the boy grumbled grudgingly, looking like an angry kitten. - I gave you my word I wouldn't visit them, in exchange for your word to keep them safe. I hold our deal dear, and I don't intend to break it.   - Then I must apologize to you for my doubts.   - No problem, but if anything, I suggest you reinforce the security spell on the lemon slice bar. I've heard a rumour that a certain weasel is going to steal them. By the way, Professor Flitwick, that includes your chewing feathers.   - Merlin - we need to get on this right away! - with a chuckle in their eyes, the professors exclaimed.    - But first, Mr. Ilya, tell us the details of your little adventure," the master of spells set the cup and with a wave of his wand moved a chair to the boy.   Ilya immediately plunged into it, stretching out his legs with pleasure.    - It's nothing," the boy waved his hand. - He was in the morning, early, out of the hole, and on his way to the highway. I wanted to hitch a ride, but the Night Knight stopped me. I got half a pound to Ottery, where I did some shopping. Clothes were tattered and a little too small. Then I decided to get some air and went to the cinema. I was so pleased with the show that I hung there until the last session. When I was coming back I bumped into two pharaohs. They wanted to press me, but I waved off and rushed to the woods. And then, as you know, I fell asleep, woke up, came back.   All the while, Professor Flitwick, most versed in the boy's speech, was moonlighting as a prompter, translating the speech into a language everyone present could understand.    - You fought the Muggle Aurors? - With respect and a certain pride, the twins asked together.   - Fred! George! - shouted the missus. - It's nothing to be proud of!   - Not the first time," the boy shrugged, not noticing the exclamation.   - Ilya!   - Whoa! Oh, wow!   - You three, stop this at once!   The twins and Ilya glanced over and winked at each other, Arthur and Molly rolled their eyes.    - Quite an entertaining story, Ilya," Dumbledore gleamed and hid a smile in his beard. - I'm glad you're finding some amusement here as well. Well, Molly, Arthur, thank you for the tea, and I think that Filius and I should be getting back.   - Yes, yes - of course," she nodded, and led the cheerful old men to the fireplace. - I'm sorry to disturb you.   - It's all right," Flitwick was still chuckling. - We're used to it now. I don't mind seeing you so often, Ilya, but really, everyone's entitled to a vacation. Have pity on our old bones.   - No promises," Weasel hummed.   - Ilya!   - You're in your repertoire, Ilya, in your repertoire.   With those words, Flivtic disappeared into the fireplace's flames, which soared upward in green columns, and Dumbledore disappeared after him, too. There was silence in the living room.   - We're going to have a very serious talk, young man," said Mollie Weasley in a low voice.   Ilya shook his head sadly. A couple of hours of lecturing were assured for him.  Chapter 12.   August 17, 1992, Aglia, "Nora."       - He never responded to any of the letters! - Ron kept sputtering. - And your feuilleton idea was completely stupid!   - With the phone," Ilya corrected, wondering whether or not to raise his bet. The twins, it seemed, decided to unite, in order to beat at least in one deal the cunning Weasel. Most likely, one of the redheads, had two pair. Too strong to play just a pair of nines. And the runner-runner is only one - a nine on "last street". The chance of a card falling out is as slim as the improbable plot of events in which Ronald finally shuts up. Even Ginevra, who was sitting with the magazine, was likely to agree.   - It doesn't matter!" the tall kid kept his line. - It didn't work anyway.   - It didn't work only because you decided to talk yourself," Ilya shrugged. - Raising ten.   Weasel moved ten candies across the table, he went all in.   - Call! - the twins shouted together. The whole trio sat without candy. The bank had collected them all.   - We're opening up.   Ilya laid out his pair, while Fred exposed a full zero, and George a pair of kings and sixes. Smart guy.   - You blew it, old Ilya," sneered Fred. How could they ever be confused? Different people.   - Don't be so hasty, Dread," Weasel brushed him off. - I'll see who's got the point upwind.   - Ugh, how rude...   - ... and not intelligent...   - ... did you write down Dread's expression?   - Of course, Forge!   With trembling hands, the boy reached into the deck, removed the top two cards, and then with a loud clap and a pirate smile placed a nine on the table.   - Mordred and Morgana! - the twins exclaimed.   - Party, gentlemen hussars. Candy for the barrel.    - If you were a regular Slytherin...   - ... we'd say you were cheating...   - ... but you're not exactly crazy...   - ... to cheat on Gemini.   - Sure!" the musician smiled, shoveling his rightful loot into his pockets. Well, not exactly legal loot.   Naive Chukchi kids, Ilya may not have been a Slytherin in the usual sense of the word, but still he'd lived in Scary Square for almost twelve years. Playing poker, he always had a few aces up his sleeve. In every sense of the phrase...   - We have to do something! - Ronald wouldn't let up. He got up and started pacing in circles around the living room.   Mr. and Mrs., off to Longbottom's grandmother's, who lived nearby, left the children alone. Percy, who had never left his room, where he was probably writing the hundredth page of a message to the incomparable Clearwater, was put in charge. That's what losing your virginity does to mere nerds - it blows all the shutters off the floodgates of eloquence. He's probably been describing the beauty of her lips for an hour, unless, of course, he's down to her chin. I wonder if when he gets to his feet, Leo Tolstoy will strangle himself with envy of the volume of the netherworld?   - Do it," Ilya shrugged. He was ready to talk to Potter himself last time, but the redhead prevented him from doing so by snatching the receiver from his hands.   - But what?! - The redhead barked, plopping down on the couch. - Even Hermione can't tell!   - Is this your way of asking me for an answer or are you just pissed off?   - Back off, slug," Ronald hissed.   - And they say I'm rude," Ilya sighed. - I'm not going to be able to do that.   - No!" the twins exclaimed together.   - Yuck," the kid mumbled, rubbing the tail of his bandana.   - Look, weasel...   - ... maybe you've already...   - ... you tell me your plan...   - ... to save Harry?   - I don't need help from a fucking slug! - With all his tinned throat, Ronald bellowed. But no one paid him any attention. Not even Jean. Apparently she cared more about her idol than her brother. There they were, women. Tricky, scary creatures.   - I have a crazy idea," said Ilya, chewing on a piece of grass he had brought from the yard.   - What is it about? - Fred asked.   - In a nutshell, it's stolen.   - I'm guessing that's Dad's Fordy," George said with a smart grin.   - You're laughing," Ilya winked. - Look how well that works out. I know where Littlewing is, I've been there before. We'll be back in a few hours with the flying machine, and your folks won't have time to get back.   - How are we going to find Potter's house? - Fred switched to a conspiratorial whisper.   It was the Twins' way of doing things, if they didn't finish each other's sentences, they spoke in strict order. It was as if they had one mind for two. It must be nice to have a brother who would understand even in a situation where it was impossible to understand.   - Including a thinker," the slightly boastful boy wagged a finger. - If Potter isn't sending letters to his mate, consequently, his blond owl can't fly out of the house.   - Which means," George pushed for an answer.   - That there were bars on the house! - Ilya clapped his hands together. - All we'll have to do is to find a house in the street where there will be bars on the second floor, in the living part!   - Not bad...   - ... for a Slytherin!   - In business? - Ilya asked.   - In business," the Twins answered and nodded together.   - Hey, Ronnie-boy, you in or out?   - With you," the boy grumbled. - Gene, you got my back?   - Yes," the girl nodded.   The four boys got up and weaved their way out, toward the garage, where Mister's littered Ford was waiting for them.   - Look, who...   - ... drive, this thing?   - Me," Ilya shrugged, closing the door behind him. It was nice outside.   - Do you know how to drive? - Ron almost choked. He was probably jealous. Not that he was any more jealous than the youngest son in a family with a bunch of older brothers, but he had plenty of it.   - Yeah," Ilya shrugged again. - I've been stealing cars since I was seven.   - And before the pedals...   -... what did you get?   - Wooden bars were taped to the legs. But there won't be a problem with that now.   The four adventurers reached the garage, where Ilya, remembering the arrangement with Mrs. and Mr., opened the lock with picklocks. It only took him a couple of seconds. In a year of putting up school broomsticks, the guy was pretty good at it. There was a click of the switched on lamp, and among the pile of junk, an old Ford England gleamed with blue paint. A four-seat family car, in which, with the Wizard's trick, an entire football team could fit, and still have room.   - Saddle up, gentlemen. The Hussar feat calls us!   - For hussar exploits...   - ... you're not old enough to...   -... Ilya's baby.   - What a bunch of pissants," the kid growled, flicking the key that was in the glove compartment. Arthur, you country boy, you don't understand anything about stealing in sixty seconds.   The garage doors were still open and the car, becoming invisible, disappeared into the clouds.   A few hours later.       - I'm pretty sure we've flown over here before! - Red almost sobbed.   Ilya only mentally cursed with the most select and filthy swear words. Who would have guessed that flying a Fordick was not the most trivial thing to do. They were barely out of the Channel at all when they were overcast, then they had to hurry to put a jamming charm on the car and a hundred other charms. Well, not them, but the twins. And all because a couple of times military planes flew by, apparently in search of stealth or some other military crap. One time they were nearly shot down by a passenger airliner, or almost shot it down, it is not clear at once. But the biggest problem was the birds. The car would have to be cleaned of their droppings and feathers for a week. Now, when it was long after dark, and the street lights were on, the band of adventurers had at last reached the county of Surrey.   - Bummer, Ronald," Ilya sniggered, pointing a finger at the sign with the name 'Little Winging' on it. - Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing our airline, Gemini and Weasel, we wish you the best of luck in rescuing the Boy-who-fucked-it.   Ilya made a steep turn that would have made a fighter jet jealous, and then came down sharply, hovering almost over the rooftops. The muffling spells worked well, and none of the muggles noticed anything. The handling of the ford was quite tolerable. There were two levers under the steering wheel instead of turn signals. One lowered the altitude, the other raised it accordingly. It was necessary to push a turn with one finger on the necessary lever, and to twist a turnbar with one hand. It may seem rather complicated, but, really, it couldn't be simpler.   - Let's see...   - ... in all four...   - ... a pair of eyes.   Slowing down to eighteen miles, shifting into second gear, Ilya began circling slowly over the uniformly lavish houses. Every yard had a manicured lawn with flowerbeds and shrubs. Under the awnings were lawn mowers, and some of the inhabitants even had automatic sprinklers, whose mushroom-shaped steel domes gleamed in the light of the full moon. A rattling sound came from the mahogany engine, and a little rattle from the suspension, which clearly did not know what aerodynamics meant. How it had not fallen off because of air resistance, only Arthur knew. If it were not for the law that one could not work magic on Muggle things, one could make good money on the clunker, or rather, on the idea. But what isn't, isn't.   The airmobile turned the second curve and sailed over the house, which reeked of cats even from this distance. Or rather, their stale hair, toilets, and food.   - Found it! - shouted Ronald.   The redhead leaned impudently out of the window and poked his hand at the house, which had a grille on the second floor. Fred, who was sitting next to him, quickly dragged his brother into the cabin.   - Well done," one of the Twins nodded. - Now the Muggles will have a legend, about half a boy flying over the city.   Ilya turned the car around and flew as close to the window as possible. Indeed, the bars, heavy metal, nailed on steel hinges, anchored in strips embedded in the frame. Made for the ages, but clumsily. They should have been fixed not to the frame, but to the wall. It would have been almost impossible to tear out that way. And now, in fact, the shutters are only held on by the nails that nailed the frame. No, this house is clearly not home to the most forward-thinking jailer.   - Forge," whispered Ilya. - On the count of three, take off the cloak.   The boy put his finger on the headlight switch.   - Three!   The cloak, with the loud rustle of a falling dress, was gone, and the amplified faraway light hit the windows. Ilya began to flick the switch quickly, quickly. He didn't know Morse code, but you wouldn't find a single person in England who didn't know how to signal SOS. After a few moments, there was a stirring in the room. Ilya turned the car around so that the port side, where Ronald was sitting, was in front of the window.   - Ron? - There was a boy's sleepy voice.   - Yes, Harry! - the redhead guessed not to shout. - It's me!   - What are you doing here?!   Ilya was ready to blow gas and get out of this place. I was ready to go out of the place and get out of here.   - We've come to rescue you!   After that, the cabin began to stir. Dread found a pre-prepared rope on the floor, fortified with charms, and carefully taped the metal cat to it, applying a perpetual bonding spell to the knot. Clever.   - Harry," the twin hissed. - Catch!   Most likely the bespectacled one had a reflex, as he caught the cat sharply and skillfully. Makes me jealous.   - Attach it to the grid and move away.   Potter obeyed the order instantly, apparently tired of playing the Rapunzel. Maybe I should have asked him to let his hair down and use it to tear out the bars.   - Done Weasel," Fred informed me.   - Ready," Ilya growled, more for courage than anger.   The boy pushed the clutch to the floor, put his hand on the raised handbrake, and then sharply pressed the gas to the floor, removing the clutch and releasing the handbrake. The car, like an angry bull, roared off and ripped through the grate with the meat. Dread immediately reeled off the rope, and with the grating it crashed straight into the flower bush, destroying it like a nuclear warhead had wiped Hiroshima off the face of the earth.   - Faster Harry! - Ron almost squealed.   At this time Ilya, panting, turned the car around, at the same time levering the trunk open. Soon a massive trunk moved into the bottomless hole of the trunk itself. Weasel immediately slammed it shut and swung the car sideways. Potter, holding a cage with a white owl in it, climbed out the window. It was too far, he had to fly closer. The redhead reached out and began to help his friend climb in, which wasn't easy. The car did not want to freeze, and swayed as if on waves.   Suddenly there was a scream on the stairs, then a stamping of feet. In the darkness of the little room a half-light was visible, streaking neatly across the doorway. There was a frantic scrambling of locks and bolts. Is Potter being kept as a house wizard, or is it simply that the safety of the Hero is paramount? However, Ilya cared little. He got his adrenaline dose and did not regret the adventure.   In less than a heartbeat the door was almost knocked off its hinges, and a burly, huge, walrus-like man appeared in the cramped room. At first Prunyra thought it was a mop standing beside him, but no, it turned out to be a terribly ugly woman with a horse-neck and a face that had never forgotten the carpet-bombardment of teenage pimples. Creepy. The kind you only see with a bag over your head and five liters inside, as the elders at the orphanage used to say.   - You're not leaving, you little shit! - I'm not going anywhere," he growled, and then he sprinted toward the shaggy-haired man.   Potter was about to climb into the cabin, but he didn't get there in time. He was grabbed by powerful arms and dragged down. Both Fred and Ronald were holding the boy, but they weren't as comfortable as a wrestling sumo wrestler leaning against the wall. It smelled like kerosene.   - Hold the wheel! - Weasel shouted to George.   The inveterate joker immediately grabbed for the bar. Ilya, wasting no time, opened the door, and hinged himself so that he could reach the thick, fat arms. The blade of the knife flashed and a wounded bison howled lard on its legs. The Gryffindor's jailer, from pain or surprise, loosened his grip, failed to keep his balance and flew down, finally finishing off the bush and bruising himself painfully against the bars. Ilya hoped he had broken something to himself. Ilya put his bowtie away, closed the door, thanked his partner with a nod, and gripped the steering wheel. Potter was already crouched in the back seat by this time.   - Ilya?! - I think Hairy Pineapple was stunned to the core.   - No, devil. The fairy godfather is yours! Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen, we're leaving.   The lad throttled, and the car soared into the sky, becoming invisible. Little Winging was turning into a small dot   And a few more hours later.   After wandering around in the dark, looking for the right highway, Ilya was finally on the right course. The trio of redheads were inundating Potter with unimportant stories and inquiries the whole time. Ilya could have sworn that at times he heard the measured sniffling of a bespectacled fellow student. Not surprisingly, such an adventure could wear him out, even the old Weasel was sleepy.   The car descended slowly, reluctantly, but never touched the ground. Driving off-road, in the dense, wet grass, is truly a mad venture, to get stuck like nothing you can do. So, keeping about a meter above the surface, the Fordic glided leisurely through the night air. Fireflies were flying around, accompanying, as they most likely thought, their big brother, who for some reason had two lights. In the distance, cicadas sang, and, as always, the trees rustled gently. But if you listen attentively, freeze in place, frozen as a stone, brought in the ancient times by the glacier, you can hear their distant whisper. Of course, anyone would say that it's just imagination dresses the impersonal rustling in a mysterious voice, but if the world of magic is possible ghosts, then why is it impossible to talk trees? Except what are they talking about. May be they tell each other funny anecdotes that make the bark crack, or may be horror stories, or may be ancient stories unknown to anyone except the forest dwellers.   Ilya floated out of his half-sleepy, sluggish thoughts, and he did just in time. The garage loomed up ahead, only its massive iron doors were locked. Maybe the genie had taken care of that, but a little closer, the lad saw that there was a heavy barn lock on the door. The trick was that to close the lock by snapping the bracket and locking the gate tightly, Ginevra would have to grow ten centimeters tall and weigh twenty kilograms. A petite girl simply wouldn't be up to the task. So it's a half-grandma.   - George, take the wheel," Ilya said for the second time that day, slowing to a minimum.   The redhead glanced a little suspiciously at his sidekick, but still grabbed the bar. Ilya hummed, he did his own thing...   - It was a great party," Ilya said with a chuckle. - Adios.   With these words the boy opened the door and jumped from a meter high into the wet grass. Rolling over, Ilya laid a hook and ran to the barrel that must have stood under the eaves. Just as he thought, on the other side of the house, in the window of Mr. and Mrs.'s bedroom, a light was burning and two silhouettes loomed. It seemed the adventurers had been too late and the adults had had time to return. Well, that wasn't his - Ilya's - problem now. He hadn't volunteered to take the rap with everyone else.   He pushed himself off the barrel and up the wall and onto the roof, and entered his own room. Except, not in a single movement, he threw off his clothes, swung his wand to remove the locking spell from the hatch, and ducked under the covers. A few minutes later, there were loud screams on the ground floor, which died down for a moment, and then it was all over again. About ten minutes passed as neat footsteps could be heard under the attic, less after a heartbeat the hatch creaked softly.   - Asleep? - A man whispered.   - Yes," the woman answered him. - Let's go.   The footsteps were getting farther and farther away, and Ilya was slowly falling asleep. It had been a crazy day, and he realized that he wouldn't mind doing it again. But, preferably, without any rescue missions, but just to drive an airplane. Yeah, that would be interesting.   29 August 1992 England, forest near Ottery.   The boy stepped carefully. He was careful to avoid the twigs that were lying all over the forest in what was not a chaotic mess. The boy winced as the wind blew at his back and literally clung to the warm ground, waiting for him to change direction. Ilya pulled himself up and looked closely at the trail. The little fawn, judging by the depth, had run here for no more than ten minutes. And the direction of the two patterned corners, shows that so far the young hunter is on the right route. Once again, the little fella has moved on.   There was a ravine, which must not be jumped over, so as not to frighten away a bird or a snake lurking in the bushes. The boy descended carefully to the low place and crouched down to continue walking. The head of his black-haired face peeked out from above, and then the rest of his body emerged, glinting bright blue eyes at the dark whiteness.   Finally, the child heard an unnatural, random crunch. Immediately the wizard turned to stone, huddled against the trunk of a massive tree. There, behind the bush, one could hear the murmuring of the brook and the whistling of the wind walking across the clearing. He was almost at the goal. Ilya slowly stalked down the tree trunk, crawled up to the bush and began to gently pull back a twig, making sure that the wind was blowing at his back. The branch could not be jerked sharply, or vice versa - too slow, attracting attention to himself. A golden mean was required here. Through the small gap, a herd of deer, led by the leader, appeared. He found them.   - Gotcha! - The boy wailed, jumping out of the bushes and landing on his knees and toes like a monkey.   The reindeer, not the least bit frightened, looked at the guest, and then their leader, like a man, snorted tiredly. Immediately bears, lynxes, wolves, foxes, hares and a lone elk began to appear from the bushes in the clearing. But none of the predators snarled at the herbivore, and none of the herbivore was frightened of his natural foe. All the beasts went about their business as if they were supposed to.   - Well, I'm good, aren't I? - Ilya turned to the huge bobcat, who came up to him and started rubbing his arm.   The ravenous forest cat looked at the boy and then, like a deer recently, snorted dismissively.   - That bad? - The young wizard grimaced.   Lynx shook his head, indicating that he could have done better. He suddenly gave the boy's hand a gentle squeeze with his teeth and dragged him toward the bushes. There it pointed at his trail and diligently rubbed it with its paw, then gave the boy a tangible push to the side. All of a couple of months ago, the boy would have lost his balance and fallen, but now he was expertly bobbing and swaying like a blade of grass in the wind.   - It's not my fault I have no fur on my feet," Ilya rolled his eyes, pointing to his bare feet covered in lumps of mud.   The lynx growled, making it clear that this was not her problem. In fact, from such growl the blood in an ordinary man, and not a man, should freeze in veins and the soul to make a cruise to the heels and back, but Ilya only grudgingly scowled and strode back to the clearing. There he sat down in the center, crossed his arms across his chest and continued to pout, pretending to be a resentful kitten.   He was a grown wolf, the alpha male and the leader of the pack, who approached him. He pinched the boy by the ear and poked his face with his muzzle, and then lay down, resting his huge head on the child's lap.   - You see," the boy smiled at the lynx, who was contemptuously watching the scene. - And he thinks I've done well.   A scornful snorting of various animals swept through the clearing, even the deer allowed themselves to remark that such a hunt would not have caught them off guard, even if they had been fed and drowsy. Even the old bear, always cordial to the boy, slapped him lightly on the back with her paw. Again, a couple of months ago, Ilya almost fainted from such a "light" slap, and could barely hold back the treacherous tears. But now really felt almost nothing.   - Can we play now? - the boy pleaded.   The younger generation of beasts began to howl, growl, and snarl happily, rampaging around the older animals. The younger generation of beasts began howling happily, growling, snarling, and panting around the mature animals. The public took this as agreement and immediately threw themselves into the squabble. As always, it all started with a little scuffle, Ilya tried to get each puppy, kitten, bear cub, fawn, lynx and other small animals, and they tend to bite him lightly on some part of the body. After that the usual sleigh games began. Children were running around the clearing among other animals, chasing each other like crazy devils. The adults watched this with some displeasure.   Ilya ducked from the soaring lynx, dived to the side, and immediately fell into a cunning trap, tripping over the wolf cub. He fell and was instantly covered by a screeching blanket of fur. The boy laughed, it tickled him so much. The games went on for about an hour, and then, when everyone was tired, the boy simply laid down among the animals and, putting his hands under his head, stared at the sky.   Yes, he always got along well with his four-legged companion. The worst of the stray dogs never barked at him, but instead sucked and licked his hands. Watchdogs just whimpered, begging to be petted, cats and male cats just kept nipping and dragging, trying to rub up against the boy. But the boy never imagined that he would spend most of his summer in the forest, only getting out to eat breakfast and do Charami.   Ilya decided that he was not going to do any more learning marathons. After all, his brain is enough to absorb the material and lessons, and more thorough study can be done in the den. So Ilya mail-ordered a textbook Char third year (second he had already passed the last semester) and was engaged only them, occasionally interrupting on Numerology and Runes, which again went very tight. He was also a bit stiff, and he had to do the rituals of Animagi, but that was out of the question.   After the remarkable incident of the nightcap, as the Missis called it, it had taken some serious pains to get himself a free pass. Now Ilya was obliged to come to breakfast every morning, and the Missis still tried to insist on dinner, but Weasel, having taken off his bandanna beforehand, applied his whole arsenal of "muzzles," and the mother of many children could not resist. After that, every single day, and sometimes night, the boy spent in the woods.   But here he was not only running, frolicking, and playing with the animals, though that was practically all he was doing. But! Quite often the animals kept him busy. Running with a deer in a race, swimming with bears against the stream in search of trout. Then there was a fight with these bears, grown-ups were afraid to squash the frail little man, so weasel struggled with teenagers, who were just under his build. If the deer and bears were busy, the wolves taught the boy how to run at full speed, bending at incredible angles, while not losing sight of the victim, they also taught him to rush in a jump, except that the shadow does not smeared. Bobcats showed him how to climb the smoothest trees and how to hunt so that no one in the forest would know of your presence. Hares were taught to confuse the trail, and foxes to unravel any intricately woven pattern. Beavers, how to hold their breath for long periods of time and pretend to be a snag in the water. Birds tried to teach the boy to fly, but the boy only dislocated his shoulder. After which the rest of the beasts began to carefully drive the flyers away from the clearing. In two months, his muscles, which had only been trained with iron, hadn't grown at all, but they had become much stronger, more pliable, and more enduring. As a result, the boy visually lost weight, but felt better than in the spring. And the endless games with fluffy lumps were just a sea of joy. But the summer was coming to an end and he had to remember his textbook shopping, his unfinished Potions and Transfiguration assignments, which had strengthened their place on the pedestal of his least favorite subjects. And, of course, he had to think carefully about the upcoming adventure, about which Ilya had never told anyone. However, all thinking over the adventure was that the boy just decided to take this step. After all, if he had really made some plan, then, to begin with, it would no longer be a venture, but a real operation, and secondly, it would be so trivial - not interesting.   Ilya got to his feet and looked around the clearing.   - I have to go," the boy said. - I'll be back in a year.   The beasts raised their heads and took turns coming up to poke, bite, or lick the boy. The little beasts rampaged at his feet and each got his own portion of scratching, which took quite a while.   - See you later! - The boy shouted, running toward Nora.   No one followed Ilya, it is impossible to catch up with the wind in the forest, and after two summer months, on the forest paths Pronyra moved only so - like the wind. Only birds tried to compete with him in speed, soaring behind and only occasionally lunging forward.   August 30, 1992 England, The Nora       Weasel dotted his essay on transmutation and folded the parchment into a scroll, tucking it into the box with the others. The boy stretched, crunching his vertebrae, and glanced outside the window. Devil, if you believe the sun, and you can't not believe it, he's about to be late. Ilya quickly put on his new, self ironed clothes and hurried out of the room.   He literally rolled down the stairs and then jumped onto the living room carpet. Here everyone was already assembled. Everyone - who was to go on a great trek west, where the mouth of a volcano would await them, in which the Ring of Omnipotence should be drowned and... Anyway, the Weasley family of four, and two other recruits assigned to them, were going to visit Slanted Lane to stock up on all the necessary waste paper and other archival items.   - Ilya," Molly said indignantly. - Why aren't you in your robe?   - I'll only wear this stuff when September 1st rolls around on the calendar," Ilya snorted squeamishly as he glanced at the cloaks the others were wearing.   Mrs. and Mister rolled their eyes, but said nothing. They were used to the boy's way of talking and his quirks. Potter lurked behind the adults. Do you have any idea what it's like to live with Harry under the same roof? No? It's a fucking nightmare! This shaggy-haired bespectacled boy is the apogee of shyness, modesty, insecurity, politeness and politeness. At times, Ilya was ashamed of his barefootedness. Looking at this angel incarnate, one could really begin to blame himself for a gangster's gut. God, here immediately recalls the case when Ilya found in the room where he was tested by the Twins some alchemical shit (himself volunteered, out of curiosity), magazine "Magic Girls. From the title it's easy to guess that this is the magical analogue of Playboy, except that the pictures in it move. Of course, when the nose is on the thirteenth year, then willy-nilly a lot of interest in such things. In the evening, sitting in the living room, the boy was reading a magazine, salivating, and realizing that he had chosen the pants wrong, he had to take them with the expectation that it might be too small underneath. So Harry piled into the living room, needing a glass of water. Ilya is not a greedy man and is always ready to share his joy with his neighbor, so he invited the Gryffindor to watch. In just a minute, Potter, red as an over-ripe tomato, except for the smell of steam from his ears, carried off to Ron's room, where he had been settled by the board in the person of Mrs. and Mister. And there were plenty of such instances. All in all, if there was an order of orthodox house boys in the world, Harry Potter would be their eternal leader and spiritual mentor. And Genie would be his right-hand man. As soon as the red-haired girl spotted the bicycle goggles on the horizon, he turned into a traffic light (changing color just as often) and hurried out of the range of the big green eyes. The two shynesses found each other, there was no arguing here.   - Harry, you must not have flown on gunpowder," Mrs. remarked.   Ilya snorted and still couldn't resist a joke.   - I tried to put him on a barrel of dynamite, but he refused.   The adults looked at him reproachfully, Gin with underlying hatred, Ron with mild meanness and envy, well Potter... Potter just blushed.   - No, Mrs. Weasley," the boy muttered.   - Oh, it's not so hard," said Molly, who was fond of the shaggy-haired boy. - You take a handful of gunpowder, stand in the fire, throw it under your feet, and say clearly, 'Slanting Lane.   Potter nodded uncertainly somehow, which didn't escape the adults' scrutiny.   - Percy, show him.   The tall but skinny lad nodded and took a step, raking the powder. This cog was not, in principle, about to wander off with his family, but intended to meet up with his girlfriend, for whom he'd been soaking his laundry at night.   - Slant Lane," Percy barked, and disappeared in a flash of green flame.   Harry, ruffling his hair, nudged by the full woman, stepped toward the fireplace, frozen in indecision for a moment. It's not hard to understand. Try stepping into the flames yourself, with gunpowder in your hand. The bespectacled man scooped black pellets from the pot and swung his hand, raising it too high. Some of it woke up and hit him in the nose.   - Ltyprulk," he sneered and disappeared into the flames.   There was silence in the living room for a while.   - What did he say? - Molly said in a huff.   - Oh, shit," Ilya gritted through his teeth, angry with himself. - I'm sorry I didn't think to travel the mantelpiece network myself.   - Ilya!" shouted the missus. - Arthur, what shall we do? Harry might get lost!   - We need to get to the alley soon!   After this phrase the people ran to the fireplace at the same time. In the end Ilya was the last to leave the house. Remembering the journey through the portal, he prepared for the worst. And for good reason. If in the case of the portal, the guy was compressed into a single point, now he was pulled into a long string, a cobweb or a thread. It was impossible to breathe in, and the mad dance of images, visions, and various pictures made him dizzy. But after a moment it was over. Spitting up ash, Ilya deftly jumped out into the hall of the Hole Cauldron. Ilya saw the white spots on Ron and Ginny's knees and grinned slightly maliciously. They couldn't keep their feet and he kept his balance. So good for him.   - Maloy! - a loud bass sounded.   Ilya looked around and saw the permanent bartender behind the bar.   - Tom! - the boy exclaimed excitedly and ran up to the counter.   The old tavern-keeper held out his hand to the boy with a slight smile. Ilya's palm literally sank into the man's paw.   - What's up, kid? How's the gnawing of the granite of science?   - I'm doing great, Tom. Not a single grade below "P."   - Bullshit!   - Here's a tooth. What am I, a seagull, to lie to the right and left.   - What a punk... When I was your age, I was happy to have a "W."   - Pfft," the boy snorted. - Know our people.   - Why did you blow me off with the hut? - the bartender winked. - I thought I'd listen to you strumming this summer, too.   - Yes," said the greenkeeper with a wave of his hands. - The situation is most curious. You see the redheaded family?   The bartender squinted his eyes, still wiping his glass, and then looked at Mr. and Mrs., who were talking about something. Apparently they were arguing about the best place to look for Potter.   - The Weasels?   - Yeah.   - So I see. So what of it?   - It's because I'm a resident. I'm in the Nora.   - I'm sorry to hear that," he said, his head shaking. - I'm sorry," he said, and I couldn't help but feel the pressure.   - All with a gun," the boy brushed me off. - Normal citizens, but with all sorts of quirks.   - That's a good one, then.   The boy was about to thank the tavernkeeper once more for last summer, but he was called out.   - Ilya!" shouted the missus. - 'Come.   - Come on, kid," the bartender nodded. - I'll see you later.   - See you, Tom.   The boy ran up to the family, who now took on a very combative appearance. Together they walked to the brick wall, where Arthur clicked on the right bricks. Through the archway that opened, they entered the magical part of London. Ilya had forgotten how weird and magical everything was here for a year. And it's quite lively. The whole crowd wandered like a living, colorful sea.   - Hermione! - There was a shout.   Ilya rolled his eyes and looked in the direction Ronald had gone. There, by the shop with flying cauldrons and jingling test tubes, was an ordinary well-to-do family. A tall man in stylish clothes, a woman in an expensive business suit, and a disheveled girl in a black robe. Danger turned around and smiled at her friend, enclosing him in a tight hug for a moment. The redhead was embarrassed. Another embarrassment. And where was the world going if girls were now hugging guys, thereby embarrassing them. The sexual revolution was upon England, it was time to do the legwork.   - Good afternoon," Ronald said awkwardly. - Are you Hermione's parents?   - She is," the tall man nodded toward his wife. - I can't be 100% sure about myself.   - Daddy!" the girl shrieked.   Ilya whistled; it takes a lot of balls to make jokes like that in front of strangers. Alas, the boy's whistle was heard by the whole fair company, who were now exchanging handshakes, hugs, and everything else that should be exchanged between the sympathetic parents of two friends.   - And you, I suppose, Ilya," the man said with a little anger in his eyes.   The boy got his bearings right away; he knew what kind of anger it was. It was the same way beasts looked at those who had the misfortune to touch their young. Perhaps the boy should have been nervous, but really, after two months in the woods, among the most dangerous of beasts, do you think anything could have made the boy nervous?   - In the flesh," the boy bowed playfully.   The adults looked at the boy reproachfully, but he didn't care. The Weasleys had never been able to reanimate the rudiment called modesty in the boy's soul.   - Hermione wrote about you," the stern-looking woman remarked. - Mostly negative.   - Wow," the boy exhaled. - I'm not even on the stage yet, and they're already writing about me! What's going to happen in three years? The New Salem Times would acknowledge me as the sexiest wizard of a generation?   - Ilya!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. together.   No one knows what would have happened next, but at the same instant, the giant Hagrid appeared from around the bend, leading the grimy Potter, whose glasses had broken.   - Harry! - Now Danger and Ronald were the choristers.   The children immediately cuddled, followed by a long acquaintance procedure, which ended in a caf at Fortesquire's. Ilya, not betraying himself, took three scoops of ice cream and hot chocolate, paying for himself. Bosote abhorred the fact that someone could pay for him, it was somehow ... disgusting. Soon it became clear that Potter had been to Yew Lane, and judging by Trio's conspiratorial glances, had seen something there. Hagrid was off on his own business, so the adults began to get acquainted.   Hermione's parents seemed like completely different people at first glance: Mr. Richard Granger is a tall, handsome man with perpetually disheveled hair, a jolly joker who, in his thirty-seven years, has had many jobs, from longshoreman to assistant head doctor at the dentist's office. He's always joking about it: "I've come a long way from being a spermatozoon to assistant to one of the chief boneheads in this part of London." Mrs. Maria Granger was the exact opposite of her husband: she barely reached his shoulder height, her facial features were soft rather than beautiful. Dressed in a strict suit coupled with a serious expression, she gave the same impression as Hermione had on the first day we met - a know-it-all, always prying to be bossy.   And, apparently, she was the unspoken head of the family, since her daughter resembled her mother so much. Again, however, the Weasel cared little for these people. He only occasionally glanced outside, trying to find some amusement. He was too bored, everything around him felt like it was breaking through thick kissel. There were too many words flying around, too slow-moving people on the street. Too much gesticulating in the caf. The boy didn't like it, and more and more he was mentally transported to the clearing with his four-legged friends.   - Oh, dear!" cried the missus. - There's an Event coming up at Florish and Bolts!   Yes, yes, that's right, the Event, capital letters. Molly Weasley adored Gilderoy Lockhart, a popular mage writer. Ilya himself, having glanced through a couple of books of this graphomaniac, then regretted that he could not burn out of memory this sugary nonsense, which had in itself not only that no literary value, but also written in the poorest and most boring language. But wizards were eating it up, because they were unfamiliar with Muggle literature, and they had no choice.   The company packed up and raced down the street, arriving at the door of the shop in only ten minutes. The bookshop was full today. The countless shelves were crowded with all sorts of people. What they all had in common, however, was that they were holding coloured books, and everyone was staring at the register as if he were a monkey under the hypnosis of a python, where the writer stood upon a peculiar pedestal. He was tall and handsome in the face, but there was too much affectation in his gesture, tone and smile. As if you were looking at a typical representative of a weak-ass stratum. Ilya shuddered. He had never had any tolerance for gays and their sympathizers. It was too disgusting and unnatural, it reeked just like ghosts and ghouls and trolls and Potions.    Molly Weasley began pushing through the crowd, making her way into the fan zone, where wizarding girls between sixteen and twenty-four were sighing languidly. The cauldron of books the "caring" mother had bought was shoved into her daughter, who nearly collapsed under the weight. If it hadn't been for all the barbs and tons of pestilence that Jean had unleashed on Ilya's head, he would surely have taken the burden away from her. As it was, Ilya pretended not to notice.   - Merlin, if it isn't Harry Potter himself! - Lockhart almost cocked his head as he started dragging the fuzzy-haired Pineapple Hair, to his makeshift stage. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to announce that our little event has been attended by Harry Potter himself!   The people groaned, the writer beckoned to the photographer and gestured to him to take a picture. He leaned sharply toward the vulture and whispered something to him, smiling at the same time. Harry tried to smile too, but it wasn't as spectacular as the scribbler's, obviously he had practiced that Hollywood smile a lot.   - I am proud to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that not only will Harry Potter not have to pay for the complete collection of my writings, which he will receive as a gift. But also, this school year, I will have the good fortune to teach at the best magic school in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself, Gilderoy Lockhart, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!   The cameras clicked again, and Harry jumped down sharply, holding a pile of books in front of him. However, the waste paper quickly passed into the hands of Molly, who began to push for autographs. The woman herself had no time to do two things at once - pushing and holding books - so she harnessed Arthur and Danger's ancestors as well. The children were left alone, standing by a display case on which lay far more interesting works than "How I Defeated a Vampire Without Soiling the Mantle of Hemilieu." How did he come up with a title like that? Maybe queer wizards don't just kick ass, they kick brains, too. That's disgusting.   - God, we're so lucky," Hermione sighed. - Lockhart is a great wizard.   - Yeah," Ilya grimaced. - The only thing this moron's got big is that hole between his buns.   - And all you have is an inflated ego and the amount of dirt in your mouth," Hermione snapped.   - I can take my pants off and show you what else I have.   The girl blushed and slowly opened and closed her mouth, and the boys just goggled. Weasel rolled his eyes. It was impossible to cross "swords of eloquence" with these homies in a dignified altercation. Just move to some dirty jabs, and they begin to impersonate river and sea inhabitants. Boring.   - I see the Weasley family is not only poor, but insane as well," came a pompous, cracked voice. - Turns out they have a daughter, too.   Draco Malfoy was coming down the second floor stairs, dressed as smartly as ever and looking like a slick worm.   - Girl, if I were you, I'd rather go to school naked than in these rags.   - Shut your mouth Malfoy!" Ron barked, covering his sister with himself.   The girl, who didn't suffer from a fuzzy personality, had somehow lost her fighting spirit. Most likely, Potter's presence was taking its toll. Her brown eyes grew traitorously moist, her petite figure shrank back, and her fingers grew pale, clutching the cauldron's cradle.   - Merlin, the whole bunch is here," Malfoy grinned. - Potter, have they been asking you for gold from the bank by any chance? If you don't, you could throw away all their ancestral heritage.   - I'll kill you! - The redhead growled, but his friends held him back, as usual.   - Get lost Malfoy," Hermione hissed.   The Slytherin's face immediately twisted in a grimace of disgust.   - You weren't asked to get dirty...   - Yo blondie," Ilya stepped out from behind the rack, where he'd disappeared before the altercation began. - How's it going?   - It's getting crowded in here with the amount of scum," Malfoy muttered, glaring fiercely at Ilya.   - And here I thought we'd be overwhelmed by the amount of shit in your pants.   - Do you wish to clean? I heard the Weasleys put you in the bathroom, so I'm not surprised at your knowledge in that area.   - Merlin, if that were really the case, I bet even seven people couldn't shit as much as one blondie could. Or one? Look, Draco, why don't you tell us what your sexual preference is? Cause if I'm right, Lockhart over there would love to have you in his loving arms.   - You bastard! - Draco was about to grab his wand when a silver cane made in the shape of a snake's head rested on his shoulder.   - Son," said a tall, broad-shouldered man with long, straight blond hair.   The man was stately and handsome in his own way, but Ilya's trained eye determined the man to be a slimy, cowardly man. The children were frightened and awe-struck by him, but the weasel felt only indifference, mingled with a touch of disgust.   - Don't pay any attention to these," as it wasn't hard to guess, the man was Lucius Malfoy. If anyone wished, they could add the prefix Lord, but Ilien had all those titles off the top of his head, and absolutely no sneeze, but a slightly different action to take.   - And this must be Harry Potter and his friends," with those words, Malfoy senior held out his cane and bent back the shaggy-haired man's bangs, exposing his famous scar.   Ilya thought that if the blonde had tried to extend her stick to his face, he would have immediately learned what a bear kick in the balls was.   - Lucius! - a growl came from beside me.   The rest of the company appeared in the combat zone. Hermione's parents loomed behind them. They were nice enough people, but Ilya could smell their insurance stench spreading through the air. They were afraid of magic, accepting, but afraid.   - Arthur," Malfoy spat as if to spit, then grabbed one of the textbooks that were in Gin's cauldron. - Still can't buy your kids anything that hasn't been to a hundred other people before?   - Get lost Lucius," Arthur continued to growl, thus reminding his youngest son.   - Merlin, how badly you've fallen. Messing with these," the blond senior nodded at the Granger couple.   - By the way," interjected Potter, who was already pumped up and in a fighting mood. - Hermione is the best student in the course.   - Whoa! Whoa! - quite loudly, Ilya indignantly drew the attention of those present to himself. - I don't want to argue - but let's face it, the Best Apprentice is me. Although yes, I'm that one, too.    Arthur was blushing more and more, and it was obvious that one more twig could be thrown into the flames and there would be an explosion, read as a fight. No, weasel was no fool to fight, but not in front of a hundred people. So he could be sent to pharaohs, and these devils would do everything to him. You go in as a simple hooligan, and you come out in a wooden mackintosh fifty years later, convicted and caught by a maniacal murderer.   Lucius Malfoy tilted his head sideways, gazing into the handsome face that was now crossed with a pirate smile. Suddenly the nobleman raised his stick and actually reached for Ilya with it, but the ebony was intercepted so quickly that people only noticed the gray shadow.   - I'm not Pinocchio," the tall boy said calmly. - I'm not Pinocchio," said the tall boy calmly.   Malfoy grinned predatorily, yanking the stick back with force, intending to slash the boy's palm with his knob. But, surprisingly, despite the force of the jerk, the cane didn't move a millimeter. Only the veins on the kid's hand swelled up. For a moment, Ilya was filled with the kind of fierce, brutal rage he'd felt only when Snape tried to take his butterfly from him. It was only a moment, brief but enough for Malfoy to look into the boy's eyes. Not a single muscle flinched on Lucius' face, not a single pose changed, not even a breath hitched. There was just the flicker of doubt in those passionless eyes. After a moment, Ilya, who had calmed down, let go of the cane.   - Come on, Draco, don't stoop to their level.   The Malfoy couple left the room with their heads held high. The closing door rang with a drunken chime.   - Ugh," Ilya exhaled, adjusting his bandana. - Don't you find it easier to breathe now that those faggots are gone?   - Ilya!" the four adults shouted together.   "An addition to the ranks of clean-cutters," thought Ilya as he left the store and headed for the fireplace. After tomorrow a new school year began.Chapter 13   September 1, 1992 England, King Cross Station       Hundreds of people, like flies in a jar, swarmed here and there, moving from the trains to the stairs and back, but none of them noticed the strange-looking people who sought to collide with the seemingly brick slab that separated the two platforms. Here the two tall and outwardly identical guys accelerated. Their carts screeched wearily, wheels scraping against the concrete floor, but there was no collision. The pair passed through the brick like a light waterfall, leaving only a slight ripple behind them. Following them, another young man, now almost a young man, hurried along. The red-haired girl glanced around slowly, a little uneasily, but came across a blurred look in her large, green eyes. She blushed suddenly, looked away sharply, and clutched at the sleeve of the fat-looking woman. The woman, along with a broad-shouldered man, embraced the girl and just disappeared behind a barrier. But no one saw it.   No one, except the three guys standing next to him. One was too tall for his age, but a little plain in the face, so he didn't look older. The other, a medium-sized guy with disheveled hair, had a keen eye that glinted behind his bicycle goggles. It added a kind of solidity to him, despite the signs of past, painful thinness. But the last guy standing there fell out of the big picture of the world like a black blot from a white canvas.   The boy was tall and athletic, as if all he did all his life was run or jump. Anyone who looked at him would have recognized him as a future Arsenal forward, but if he looked up, people would look away with a look of contempt. The lad had a handsome, too handsome face with bright blue eyes on dark whites. But for all that, there were traits about his face that a good citizen would recognize instantly, almost intuitively. They were the traits of a punk, a hobo, and a thug. The elusive facial expression, the peculiar cut of his eyes, the smirk, the bandanna, the composedness, as if ready to attack, all these attracted only Pharaohs, while for the rest of us it was a red traffic light. "Hooligan," many would say, and they would not be wrong. In fact, Ilya had never concealed it.    The redhead and the shaggy-haired man looked at each other, and Ilya rolled his eyes. They couldn't get any faster, could they? At last Ronnie-boy and Pineapple-hair made up their minds and immediately took off at a furious pace. Their carts took off and rolled at breakneck speed towards the brickwork. Just a few moments before the passage, Ilya felt uneasy. No, not for a couple of vultures at all, but the same anxiety that a thief feels when approaching a too calm, too well dressed tolerant. The thief, just a few steps into someone else's pocket, senses a set-up and immediately turns the corner, leaving the overdressed cop with nothing.    Ilya looked around, but met no danger, then looked at the barrier and immediately felt a slight prick again. And then there was a collision. The carts crashed into the brick, the boys flew over the handrail, but they were lucky - they landed on bundles and backpacks, and the trunks were held securely by leather straps. Ilya, not believing his eyes, drove closer with the cart. He cautiously put his hand to the barrier, but felt no slight tingling sensation in his palm, no sucking into the warm emptiness. Only cold stone, as if laughing haughtily at the young wizards' failure.   - What is it? - Ron wheezed as he rose.   - The passage is closed," Ilya said thoughtfully, rubbing the tails of his bandana. He always did that when he started "brainstorming" some idea.   Harry and Weasley glanced at each other and rushed to the masonry, but their hands were just as unable to reach any portal. There was a look of consternation on the children's faces, the kind you get when a teacher starts to give a grade for a test in an overly stern, disgruntled voice. It was the so-called - school fear, the danger of management, problems and other things. Fear that had nothing to do with real fear, fear that made my legs tremble and sweat roll down my back.   - You're the one who shut him down! - Weasley suddenly yelled, turning to Ilya with clenched fists. - You're the one who's joking, you disgusting slug!   The stunned Weasel turned to the redhead. He was breathing fire with anger.   - It's genius," Ilya grinned. - I've always wanted to be locked in a train station with you, so that Snape could crucify me on a cross.    - Ron," Harry voiced. - I don't think Ilya did it.   Weasley seemed to turn on his brain, which worked, if only occasionally. He realized the extent of his wrongdoing, but he didn't apologize. Ronald had never apologized to anyone. Either he considered it beneath his dignity, or he was simply too, how should I say, bullish. Ilya, though he was a punk and bums, but he did not tolerate the rednecks. The respected Professor Flitwick, perhaps the only creature on earth who had authority with Ilya, always said - "There must be charm in everything, without charm, even feats seem faded and boring". And, devil, it was pure truth. Well, Potter and Ronald were utterly devoid of charm. Yes, Mordred, even the same Malfoy, in his bastardization and podnkovaya, did have a slight touch of that very charm. Maybe that's why the weakling got away with so much, though more likely it was because of his father. Weasel himself tried to develop this trait in himself, but he had not yet figured out what the charm was, but everything was still to come.    - What are we going to do? - Suddenly Ron became agitated. - I mean, if we can't get to nine and &frac34; that means our parents can't get out of there, either.   - I'm sure you'll be fine," Ilya said, shrugging. - I'm not going to be able to get you out of here," he said, and I shrugged.   Potter shook his head sullenly and jabbed his fingers at the clock that hung nearby. There, the minute hand was moving with the inexorability of an axe being dropped on a condemned man's neck.   - We'll miss the train and Snape will never forget it.   Ilya did not argue and corrected "us" to "you". The tall-haired man would not miss an opportunity to give Ilya a bad name. But the worst thing was that he could assign work and make him wash his awful cauldrons. The weasel couldn't stand even an extra minute in that disgusting smell, let alone two hours of work.   - You can use the night...   - Daddy's Fordyke! - Weasley exclaimed, interrupting his classmate. - We can fly in Daddy's Fordy!   Ilya rarely slammed his mouth shut. Of course, a trip on the magic bus was great, but the boy's eccentric nature, adoring attention to his own person, could not pass up the opportunity, to show up at school in a flying car. And since the redhead himself suggested it, it would be a sin to interfere with his boring platitudes.    - But we don't know how to drive," Harry objected.   - Ilya can do it," Ron muttered reluctantly.   - Oh yeah, right," Hair pineapple nodded lightly and turned to Weasel. - Are you with us?   - Pfft," Ilya snorted, shifting the case onto the cart. - I mean it.   The trio, putting their carts on wheels, set off for the entrance. At the station they surrendered their wagons and dragged the trunks by hand. Despite six months of training and a summer among the beasts, it was still hard for Weasel to drag that huge torch. Redhead and Shaggy moaned, gritting their teeth. I wonder what they had stowed there? Dismembered relatives of the bespectacled man? No, I'd rather drown the corpses in acid and then throw them in the Thames. A week and whatever's left of the corpse will be eaten by the fish, and what they don't eat will be blown away by the current. So, most likely, carry scarlet stones with them, so as to throw the "nevaer" girls from the department, who dared to make out with Ilya.    The parking lot was pretty crowded, which didn't sit well with the old hijacker. When it's crowded, there's always a risk of getting caught, and on a weekend, any one of those civilians might be a pharaoh out of uniform. And then, hello, jail time. Soon the guys reached a miniature car, which, standing between two jeeps, looked like a pop singer with a couple of dumbass guards. The sun, still summer, was burning mercilessly and the two sophomores began to visibly sting with sweat. Ilya grimaced.   - How do we open it? - Potter muttered. - We're not allowed to use magic.    - Cover," Ilya whispered gangly.   Ginger and Potter stood side by side, but ran into Ilya's bewildered gaze.   - What?" the bespectacled man asked.   - What the fuck are you doing? - Weasel growled.   - Covering," Weasley shrugged.   With a resounding clap, Ilya's palm greeted his face, and the boy himself began to unintelligibly let out the dirtiest swear words. Eventually he, almost by the hand, set his classmates in their proper positions. Now, in order to spot Ilya, a random passerby had to come up close and close and stare intently.    Ilya pulled a long metal strip from his bag, with a tongue at the very end. The boy went to the door, looked around to see if anyone was around, and then slid the strip down the glass with a sharp movement. When the tongue caught hold of the bolt, Ilya made a nimble move, as if he were scooping up soup with a ladle, and then jerked the strip up. There was a click, and the door opened. An extra ignition key was found in the glove compartment. Levering the trunk open, the guy shouted:   - Load up and let's go.   Weasley and Potter were leaving the trunks into the bottomless abyss as best they could, the cage with the owl, Scarface had, as was customary, taken with him into the cabin. Ilya, all the while, was figuring out the approximate route the Hogwarts Express would take. Scotland was not Siberia, of course, but it would not be easy to find a castle there from the air. So it would be better to fall on the puffer's tail.   - Start it up," Weasley grimaced as he sat in the back seat with his friend.   - Fasten your seat belts," Ilya snorted back.   The Slytherin pressed a button, and with a loud rustle the invisibility curtain went up. The boy wasted no time at all in driving, then shifted into first, second, gave the throttle a sharp increase in revs, shifted into third, and squeezed to the floor. The car hissed, hissed, growled a couple of times and snatched like an unfaithful wife, caught on the hot and now running from her husband in the hands of a silvery pipe. The Fordick was hurtling straight towards the station wall. The Gryffindors sitting in the back seat went pale and tried to huddle into their backsides. With less than three meters to go, Ilya suddenly pulled the lever under the steering wheel, raised the handbrake, accelerated again and released the handbrake, the car shrieked and sharply began to gain altitude, taking off, parallel to the wall, and so close to it that it might have looked like it was going over it. Vulture exhaled in relief, and then saw the reflection of Ilya's adventurous grin in the mirror. At that moment, the young wizards decided that they might have made the greatest mistake of all, asking the reckless Slytherin to take the wheel.       A few hours later, somewhere in Scotland.       The car shook perceptibly, the engine howled and rattled now and then, making the sound of a mischievous child hitting a drainpipe with a rebar. At times the Ford shook, as if it did not want to obey the steering wheel. Overboard, in the night, among the clouds, weasel began to understand that, probably, he had made a couple of mistakes. Probably shouldn't have raced with the Boeing. And that time when they, or rather he - Ilya, decided that to drive through the tunnel in front of the express train's nose was enough fun... well, perhaps it was fun only for the driver. Hundreds of dead loops, barrels, engine shut down in a dive and stuff like that, it's not even worth talking about. And two vultures, judging by their whiteness, don't even want to remember it. He's a weirdo, Potter, doing all kinds of crazy stuff on a broom, but in a flying car his point is shrunk to a point, or he doesn't even have a point at all.   But most likely the last straw was when Weasel pulled up alongside the train, opened the window, and knocked on Ravenclaw's seniors and seniors' faces. That look of shock on the faces of his acquaintances was worth it, then scurrying around like an angel among the air pits and flocks of migratory birds. And now, when the fuel level was almost at zero, the magic of the machine was starting to fail.   - Are we... going down?! - Ronald squeaked.   - No, we're just going down really fast," Ilya growled.   The car went into a vertical dive, the engine stalled, and now the black blanket that was Hogwarts' courtyard was approaching inexorably in the windshield.   - We're going down! - Ronald shrieked in a way that seemed to shatter the windows.   He pulled out his wand for some reason and started twisting his head around, probably trying to find a way out of the situation. Ilya, on the other hand, twisted the ignition key and banged on the steering wheel. The car still didn't want to start and was hurtling to meet its fate.   - We're going to die! - Weasley continued to shriek.   The weasel kept turning the key, but heard only the death rattle of an inveterate smoker, the car would not start. The windows were already shaking, and my tailbone felt the fatal proximity to the not-so-soft surface.   - Oh, you f...c...t...c...t...c...c...c...c...c...c. - Weasel shrieked, and once more, almost recognizing the grass, pulled the key.   The Fordick spat out another wheeze for the last time, and then the engine suddenly roared like a hungry tiger. The car immediately started up, the headlights shone unbearably, and Ilya pulled the takeoff lever with all his might. The airplane straightened out and flew parallel to the ground at high speed. For a moment Ilya thought they were about to crash into some wispy, black blur, but then the lights picked up thick, powerful branches. There was a deafening crack, and for a while the carriage was dragged through the thicket by inertia. The windows shattered with a deafening shriek, the casing creaked with a gagging noise, and then Ilya collapsed on his instincts onto the seat next to him. And for good reason. Right above him, through the windshield, a thick branch suddenly came through, which threaded the Ford like a skewer.   - I think that's what I call a party," Ilya exhaled.   He got out somehow, feeling the car swaying and the branches crackling. The boy turned around and saw a packed Potter and a whimpering Ronald, his nose bleeding. It would have been fine if it was bleeding, though, but the sight of the snot, made the bosot cringe. And kAnd he'd played deadly chess last year, if he'd been hammered because of some sort of airplane crash.   - We're lost," Red whispered, turning even paler.   - It's all over now," Ilya brushed him off.   - It's Grim Willow! - shouted Ronald.   The weasel's heart made an intricate cruise. Gathering its things, it ran to its heels, then looked up and still decided to stay in the step area.    - P... - the orphan didn't get to finish.   Something struck the roof with force, leaving a terrifying dent in its wake. No one had time to react before another blow hit the left hull, then the right, then the roof again. In a moment the car was tossing and tossing like it was a ping-pong ball at the Chinese Table Tennis Championships. Shouts came from the cabin, screaming in three different harmonies. At one point, there was a terrible, crumpling blow right on the kat, and the Fordick flew out of the wild tree's tenacious pawing branches.   There was a palpable jolt inside the cabin as the wheels hit the hard, dry ground. Weasel wiped the blood from his split brow, rubbed his bruised side, and looked around. The redhead and the shaggy one seemed to have just an inexhaustible supply of luck. Ilya looked like a wounded kitten after the incident, but these two didn't care. Lucky bastards.   - My wand," Weasley almost cried, showing some splinters held together by a couple of wood fibers.   - "Or maybe not," thought Ilya.   But you didn't let me... didn't give... didn't give... ...didn't give it to me, it's hard to make sense of it all at once. In general, the doors opened and an unknown force threw the three students out of the salon. Then all the luggage was spit out of the trunk as if it had been spit out, which nearly killed the guys. When it was over, the Fordhicle roared its engine angrily, blinked its headlights and hissed its tires and drove off somewhere in the forbidden forest.   - That's a twist," the Slytherin shook his head, rubbing his neck. - And what the hell was your father up to? It's a fucking machine uprising! In the name of God, Skynet had gotten to the wizards. Schwartz is being summoned immediately! Is there anyone here named Conor?   The weasel, as they say, got carried away. It was his first time on such an adventure, so it was no wonder that his nerves were a little rattled. However, when the boy came across the faces of his companions, he realized that his heart began to return to its place too soon. If when they fell from a height of many meters with a stalled engine, the classmates were pale, now they were white as the first snow. Ilya overcame the urge to turn around.   - There's someone behind me," Ilya whispered.   Scarlet nodded vigorously and scrambled up somehow, as if trying to hide in the hallowed ground. Ilya sensed something wrong.   - It's Snape, isn't it? - The boy whispered.   Weasley and Potter swallowed. Illya turned slowly, as if he were a suicide bomber, and hiccupped. Above him towered Snape. His robe was flapping in the wind and it was impossible to tell with a hundred percent certainty whether it was wings or just fabric. His greasy hair, though, held up his angry, furious gaze, and his hooked, long nose had the edge of a raven's beak aiming for your heart. Weasel hiccupped a second time.   - Professor," the boy smiled tautly. - We've been... ...went for a ride. How was your summer?   - To the Headmaster," Snape hissed. - Now.   Ilya sighed heavily and shook his head. Things were taking a bad turn. Ilya turned around to get his trunk, but surprisingly enough, neither his nor the Gryffindor's trunks were there anymore. They had simply disappeared. Yes, strange things were happening at Hogwarts. Ilya only hoped that this time, too, things, mysteriously and incomprehensibly, moved directly into the room.   The trio gathered their spirits, with Harry taking a very long time to find that very spirit within himself and even rising to his feet, unable to look the Dean of Green in the eyes. Snape, on the other hand, increasingly irritated, looking at his ward and his classmates, had already turned around a hundred and eighty, inspiring awe at his resemblance to Count Dracula, and then ducked into the archway. The people followed him.    The castle greeted them cordially and warmly. On the walls, as always, unlit torches burned, which, as the now-second-year student found out, were almost five centuries old. It was in those times that such mysteries were invented. It was ironic that they had been using magic lights for a long time, but torches were kept in Hoge for atmospheric purposes. The boy even liked such an archaic, immediate transition from the usual world to the world of magic. If there had been daylight here, it would have seemed that you were only on a tour of Yorkshire or somewhere similar.    As they walked up the stairs to the first floor, Ilya could hear the commotion coming from the Great Hall. Well, they were late for dinner, but as Flitwick says, "You have to pay for pleasure. He chuckled, though, and then he began to get very pensive about his wild days, but the meaning of the phrase didn't change with the degree to which it was vulgarized.    In one of the dark recesses, the boy noticed some huge, surreal pile, but then he recognized it as stacked trunks, which now represented one of the pyramids of Giza. On top were the trunks of three tardy students. It was so strange that the young man did not even immediately realize that the trunks had overtaken them somewhat.   Snape, on the other hand, had almost brought them to the second floor, where the headmaster's office was. The staircases, as they always did, immediately took up position as soon as they heard the rustling of a black, silken robe. And some very sensitive people, just by stepping on them, could swear with their wand that they could feel them trembling beneath the potionsmith's feet. Weasel, having calmed down a bit, put his hands behind his head in his usual manner, and began whistling an immortal tune. Probably this song about little birds, which had flown in on the threshold of the morning, became something like a personal hymn for the orphan. Simple, simple rhyming lines kept a precept that the boy kept strictly to: don't pay attention to small problems, because everything will be all right in the end. And going to the headmaster, the lad certainly considered it a "minor problem". Dumbledore wouldn't rule them out, even if the youngsters flew the car right into the Great Hall. The kindest of souls, the old man had never expelled anyone in his whole life as Headmaster. Well, the work-outs are no big deal, as long as Flitwick gets the new tea. The points won't be taken off anyway, the year hasn't really started yet, no one has any points at all.   Soon the gargoyle appeared in front. She looked posh and proud and unapproachable at first. But as soon as she saw the tall-haired man, she shrank back, squeezed her shoulders, and disappeared into an alcove behind the wall. The doorway was opened and a winding staircase took people up to the carved doors with marvelous ornamentation. Those opened and revealed the office of the head of the school. It had not changed at all over the summer. The same strange objects on numerous shelves, cupboards and books remained in their place, and, certainly, a table with fancy legs and cloth on the table. Only the hat was out of sight, and there were some minor changes, which, however, did not disturb the integrity of the picture.    Just as the children approached the table, four chairs materialized out of thin air. Four, because Snape was there, but the professor took a step back, and his chair disappeared into silvery smoke.    - Sit," the professor spat, and hurried off behind the management.   When there was a stone screech and no more rustling of the mantle, Potter and Weasley exhaled in friendship and sprawled like jelly on a chair. Shaggy was visibly sweating, and now rubbing his new-fangled glasses diligently. Or rather, the old glasses that Danger had fixed with a spell. Why Hair Pineapple hadn't repaired them himself, if he could punch through a wall with a repulsion spell, Ilya didn't know. Perhaps the bespectacled man feared that his Reparo would turn the "bikes" into a second Hubble. Weasley, by the way, is not one of the weaklings either, can easily with cotton legs, turn you into a mermaid. As for Ilya, you and I know very well that he is the weakest student in all of Hogwarts, except that he is handsome and does not get marks below "P".    - We're screwed," the redhead wheezed. - We're going to get expelled. Snape will take care of that.    - Everything will be cucumber," Ilya brushed him off.   - And the ford went feral, too," Ronald continued his whining, not noticing his classmate's insinuation. - What am I going to tell my father now. And Mum's bound to find out, too... Merlin, we're in for a thunderclap! The whole school will be laughing...   - And you laugh with them," Ilya shrugged.   - Nothing Ron," Harry ignored the Slytherin now, too. - McGonagall will help us somehow.   - Do you really believe that? - smiled gravely at the boy-who-will-ever-be-in-trouble's friend.   - Right! - suddenly bellowed Ilya, and he was immediately noticed. At last. - Anyway, you kids, if you don't want to go back to London, don't say anything. Comrade Top Apprentice will do the talking. I'll get us off.   - Why do you always have to call us toddlers? - He was suddenly shrieking.   - Because you're shallow," Ilya grinned. - Just kidding. It's just that you look like them. I don't know why.   - Maybe we should call you something, too. - Ron tried to sneer, but it didn't work. - How about "slimy slug"?   - And you're a goddamn humorist," Ilya's ulcer came out all right. - But I already have a nickname: Weasel. So you're a little late with the initiative.    - That's an odd nickname. Why is it exactly like that? - The bespectacled man asked.   Ilya was about to answer when he heard the creaking sound of doors opening.   - It's quite an interesting story, Mr. Potter," came a familiar, slightly carking voice.   The whole foursome walked into the office. Here, as with any boil related to Ilya, were the Headmaster, now dressed in his ceremonial robe of stars and crescents, McGonagall, stern as ever and with slightly slanted glasses. Snape, about whom I need not add anything. And the perpetually mocking Flitwick, rubbing his belly - Ilya wasn't the only one who liked a hearty meal.    The teachers settled into their chairs, and only Sallow-Haired stood to the side, putting his hat back where it belonged. Perhaps he was afraid that someone would lose his temper and throw soapy spells at him.    - Professor, we... - Potter started to speak, but got a painful poke in the shin and immediately shut up.   - Director! - splashed his hands smiling Ilya. - How are you doing? How was the holiday?   - Quite curious," Dumbledore nodded. - This year, the brothers, Fred and George, were able to hit such a high note that I had to restore some of the stained glass windows. Really, I suspect it was their trick, and not their operatic abilities at all.    - Wow, that's quite a spectacle to miss.   - Don't play dumb, Ilya!" exclaimed the Iron Lady. - This is a very serious matter! It's about expulsion!   - Exception?! - Potter and Weasley exclaimed together, and were about to say something else, but they were interrupted in time by Ilya.   - The case is clearly a dark one," he quoted a Slavic priest, sometimes feeding the orphans. - As far as I remember, there is no clause in the rules that forbids flying cars into the school.   - You're right, but there's a "but,"" Snape nodded forward. He seemed willing to sacrifice his ward to get rid of Potter and his henchman. - The rules clearly stated that a student must, without fail, board the Hogwarts Express.   - Yeah," Ilya nodded. - Except you forgot to mention that it's amendment number 375, from 1843. The apprentices used to come in flying carpets, until, because of a storm that killed a quarter of a thousand young wizards, they were deemed too dangerous and banned. Now, there's a caveat to this clause - paragraph 3, subparagraph - "b". I quote, "Unless the wizard has other reasons not to do so," and the amendment, "d," says, and I quote, "Unless the wizard is prevented from doing so by an insurmountable circumstance."    - You know the law very well," Dumbledore winked at the boy as he chewed his slices. Well, well, let him chew, he won't have long to enjoy his treat...   - You should always know the laws," the boy smiled.   - To use them skilfully," remarked a grinning Flitwick.   - Filius! - exclaimed McGee.   - Harry, my boy," the slyly-wise Dumbledore seemed determined to exploit Potter's naivety and gullibility. - Are you going to tell us how it happened that you and your friends flew in Arthur's car?   Ronald and Ilya pouted simultaneously, wanting to argue that Potter wasn't the Slytherin's friend at all, but the bespectacled man had already taken the floor and the boys had to shut up.    - Of course Professor," Harry nodded. - We were supposed to be the last ones through the barrier, but it just so happened that when Ron and I tried to do it, the passage closed and we crashed into the wall. While we were standing there wondering what to do, the train had already left. We were really scared that we wouldn't be allowed into the school, and that the adults wouldn't be able to get through from that side. So we took Mr. Weasley's Ford and flew it to the school.   - And who was driving the car? - Snape asked as if casually.   - Ilya," Weasley immediately turned in his classmate.    - Do you know how to drive? - McGonagall wondered. - Wait... The car was locked... So you're a car thief too?!   - I'm also a pickpocket, a safecracker, I can remove a watch bracelet without anyone noticing...   - Ilya!" all the faculty exclaimed together.   The boy only smiled, and Flitwick, looking around quickly, winked encouragingly at him.   - You asked," the Slytherin threw up his hands.   - Ilya, my boy, but you know about the Night Knight," Dumbledore smiled kindly. As a matter of fact, he doesn't know any other way. - Why didn't you use it?   Potter obviously wanted to ask what it was, but he didn't take the chance. He rarely opened his mouth in front of adults at all. Ron, on the other hand, suddenly turned pale again, and then slammed his palm across his face.   - Well," the Slytherin stretched out, then added a sneer to his tone. - You know, Professor, I always get confused in stressful situations. So I didn't think.   - You didn't think so? - Dumbledore continued to smile.   - Yeah," the kid nodded.   The headmaster popped a slice into his mouth, chewed, thought about it, and then sighed heavily. In his opinion, this was going to be a hard year, though the great light wizard had no idea how hard.   - Then I think we've got it all figured out," now the Iron Lady and Snape wanted to object, but the professor only waved his hand and they didn't dare interject. The Headmaster can be bossy when necessary... About once or twice a year... ...if he's really desperate. - They hadn't broken any rules, and there was nothing to deduct points from. So, Minerva, take Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley to the tower, and Severus, make sure Mr. Ilya doesn't get lost on the way to the dungeons.    After a couple of minutes, only Dumbledore and Professor Char were left in the study. They sat there, each thinking about his own thing, and then suddenly sighed heavily at the same time. They looked at each other and smiled at the same time. Their wards, as always, were in a hurry to create chaos and disorder, even in places where it was impossible to do even theoretically. Albus reached for the vase, but his hand only fumbled for the emptiness. The old wizard looked around, but saw only an empty container. Then the Headmaster swung his hand and a whole box floated out of his bar, which, however, was also empty. Dumbledore couldn't believe his eyes - all his lemon slices had disappeared somewhere. At that moment, Flitwick suddenly burst into hysterical laughter. The head of the Wizengamot realized it too, and laughed just as much.   - I'm afraid you've been outmaneuvered, Albus," Filius wiped away his tears. - He was in the middle of a tear.   - I see you're having fun, old friend," the light wizard sparkled his eyes. - Don't you want to check your bar?   The goblin froze abruptly for a moment, then turned pale, muttered something, and literally stormed out of the office. Albus, on the other hand, took out a parchment scroll, quickly sketched out the order, and waved his hand again. The scroll disappeared. The headmaster smiled at his thoughts and relaxed in his chair, listening to Fawkes' cooing, a bit like a snide cackle.    - And you, Brutus.   Phoenix laughed even more clearly. Yes - it's going to be a hard year.       (p.a. leave a comment, anyone reading this. Spend two minutes of your time throwing a slipper or "thank you" to the author.) Chapter 14   September 5, 1992, Hogwarts.       In spite of everything, Ilya fell in love with the school year from the very first minutes. After all, it was a school year that began on Saturday. Consequently, the next day upon arrival at the castle, there was no need to rush and hurry anywhere. For once, the boy decided to relax a little, and most likely it was because of this decision, he slept through breakfast and then lunch, waking up only at three in the afternoon. After this "sleep", Ilya went to renew his connections. That is, armed with a bandana and a guitar, he went to the crows. There he spent a whole day racking his instrument (it was decided to name it so) and talking with the audience. At one point the Puffendoos also stopped by the ravens, and then the entire fair company of fifty people emigrated to the vultures, where they spent the entire night. The next morning, the boy forbade ever to spend another night among the elders until he was at least fifteen...   Anyway, on the first day of class, Best Student was sleepy, with lipstick on his cheeks, a loose bandana, and a wacky stare. When his fingers got tired of tinkling, he was naturally used instead of a kitten to be scratched and petted. During the first days of the studies there was only a repetition of the learnt material. The teachers gave out tests, quizzes and in general did not overburden people. So Ilya was, so to speak, in slo-mo fashion, he did not even go into the den.   It was funny enough to watch Ronald at breakfast, cringing when owls flew into the castle. But apparently the redhead had figured out that no one was going to send him a thunderer, so now he was shining like a polished starlet's badge. Though the same Percy could argue with that assertion. The sixth grader looked like a rock crystal, basking in the rising sun. I mean, happy, but a little pinky. That's what regular sex with nerds does... ...is a powerful thing. Clearwater herself, by the way, was also happy and looked like a cat that had eaten a lot of sour cream.   But back to our Weasels. So, today the normal classes were to begin and that's why the sophomores of Green and Scarlet were going down to the dungeons. Ilya would not be Ilya if he did not find a way out of this situation. He had ordered a muggle construction respirator from a specialty shop by mail, which was now lying in an almost bottomless bag.   - Ilya!" the boy called out.   The guy turned around and saw a trio of girlfriends. Brown, Patil, and McDougal. The girls had grown a little taller over the summer, but besides Brown, no one else could boast of an increase in the right areas. That didn't seem to bother the girls one bit, though. They took turns hugging each other tightly, hugging each other a little longer than they should have.   - Hello, ladies," the boy winked at them. - Where have you been? I haven't seen you since the beginning of the year.   - We got held up in Philly," Lavender smiled. She was wearing a robe that revealed a blouse from beneath her school uniform. But still, the black chlenda firmly concealed the growing maiden form, and so the thirteen-year-old had the good fortune not to be distracted by such trivialities.   - It's such a state in America," Parvati explained.   - You don't say," the Slytherin stretched out a little mockingly. - I thought it was a meatball factory.   The girls snorted, and Isabelle, in her usual manner, tried to fist the boy. He had no trouble dodging it.   - Did the three of you rest there? - Ilya asked.   - The four of us, not counting my parents," Patil shook her head. - I'm sorry," Patil shook her head.   - Oh, right," Ilya didn't know Padma, his mate's twin, well, because Padma was pretty negative about Ilya, for who the hell knows why. - Was there anything interesting?   Judging by the way the girls' eyes lit up, it was clearly an unnecessary question. The beautiful boy's head was immediately flooded with a slightly confused account of his summer in the sunniest state. In the end, the most curious thing the boy found in the woman's story was an encounter with an alligator in the swamps. The lizard, if the story is to be believed, scared the crap out of a group of tourists, among whom were several aurors on vacation. No one else would be frightened by it ...   The story would probably have gone on and on, but the flaps of hell opened, letting sinful souls into the darkness... In short, with a wave of his wand, Professor Snape opened the doors of Potions class. The Griffs, as well as Ilya, somehow shrank, turned pale, and quietly crept inside at the same hour. The Slugs, on the other hand, stuck out their chests and marched to their seats with their heads held high. Weasel immediately felt that awful, crushing, disgusting smell, and after nearly three months of rest, he almost turned inside out. Gross. But he was disgusted when he made his way to the broad table with the two pots, where Greengrass was already standing at hers.   Over the summer the beautiful blonde had grown even prettier, and she was already the prettiest girl from first to fourth year. The older girls, of course, were no match for her. Many of the guys present literally devoured Daphne's eyes, who was clearly flattered by such attention. But as soon as Ilya approached, the girl immediately grimaced and hurried to move away. Ilya only tiredly shook his head and tried not to pay attention to his classmate. Behind the first desk, right in front of Snape's nose, sat the overly contented Malfoy of late, next to whom Parkinson was now standing. And while Greengrass had gotten prettier over the summer, Pansy was even uglier and now no healthy member of the male half of the castle, could look at her without shuddering. Which begged the question - how is Draco standing next to her? The answer was one, and you already knew it.   - I can see that a lot of people got even stupider over the summer," the sallow-haired bastard began, not even bothering to get up from his desk. - Although, I naively assumed that was simply not possible. Well, there's a recipe on the board, and if no one blows up the cauldron or kills their neighbor by the end of the lesson, I'll be happy.   Ilya looked at his textbook, then at the board, and closed his textbook. The potter, in his usual repertoire, had changed the recipe a little, and some things didn't agree with the textbook. Oh, well. People had already begun to open ingredient banks, to kindle the flame on the burners, and the most frisky ones were even fumbling with their stirrers. Ilya, on the other hand, was busy with something else: he was rummaging through his bag. At last the Slytherin had found what he was looking for. It was a mask with two imposing washers near the cheeks. He tightened the strap on the back of his head with one deft movement, and sighed not freely, but with evident relief.   The wizard turned to the cauldron, baring a silver knife as he went, and pulled out a jar of some unreal nastiness. Something embarrassed the boy, and he turned to his neighbor. Greengrass was looking at the fellow man like a drunkard at an alien. In utter disbelief and natural shock. Ilya shrugged, splashed some water, and lit the burner. But not with a spell like the others, but with a Zippo lighter with a Jack Daniels whiskey emblem on it. He'd bought it back in the middle of the summer; you could tell it was love at first sight.    The cauldron was immediately filled with the legs of a beetle, the blood of a squirrel or a groundhog, and then the reproductive organ of a canary. Did you even know that a canary has an organ? Anyway, this year Potions decided to outdo the vileness of last semester. Watching the ingredients of the Calm Potion splashing around in the boiling and turning orange-colored water, Ilya realized that only a dead man can be calmed with this concoction. And in general, before taking it inside, one had to add to the cauldron two liters of holy water. And it is unlikely to help.   - Mr. Ilya, what's that on your head? - Snape growled, flying over to the table in the gallery.   - Bandana," came a muffled, hissing voice from the boy.   - I mean on your face.   Then the boy looked around and realized that the whole class was looking at him. The purebloods with surprise and shock, the half-breeds and muggles with recognition. The boy coughed, wrapped himself in his robe, and lowered his voice.   - Luke, I'm your father," he wheezed, breathing heavily into his respirator.   The kids familiar with the movie started rustling and choking, trying to hide their laughter.   - Take that down at once! - Zel'evar yelled.   Taking a deep breath, gathering more purified air into his lungs, the boy lifted his mask and spat out in a curt voice.   - I have a suspicion of acute bronchitis, the doctor said not to breathe harmful fumes," with these words, the boy put the mask back in place.   Snape glared into his eyes for a while, but the bandanna kept him securely out of any light-hearted crawls. And without his telepathy, the Halfhand didn't seem able to denounce even such brazen lies.   - Keep your eyes peeled, Ilya," the professor spat out and took off toward the vultures where he confidently played back at Potter, Weasley, and Longbottom.   Of course, it was easier to breathe and the smell was no longer bothering the boy, but the subject was no better. Ilya still felt squeamish and disgusted by all the jars and pots and things in the classroom. And he certainly couldn't look at Granger, who was biting her tongue in excitement. And where was the aesthetic taste inherent in girls? Or witches don't suffer from that kind of zaniness - because there wasn't a single lady in the class who was disgusted by throwing a canary yadda into a potion. Crazy World.   - So how was your summer with Weasley? - hissed Greengrass, not turning away from the potion. - Did you scrub all their toilets? Or did they put you in the barn? You've lost weight on carrots and potatoes, I see. Poor little Ilya, have you starved him to death?   Last year, Ilya would have said something sharp. But he had grown up and had gained some worldly wisdom. That's why Ilya took two white cotton balls out of his pocket. He smiled and wiggled these balls in front of the dumbfounded Slytherin's face, then happily stuck the earplugs in his ears and snapped his fingers. Not even a muffled echo could be heard. Daphne opened her mouth, flashing her eyes angrily, saying something, but the boy couldn't hear her. Silence, no nasty smell, Snape not having a chance to get into his mind and lemon slices in his trunk. The year was off to a magical start. A pirate grin spread across Weasel's face, and another nasty thing flew into the potion.    Two lessons of magic chemistry, unlike last year, slipped by unnoticed. Ilya handed in his brew with the exact shade repeating the color requested in the textbook, and went out. He decided not to wait for the trio of Gryffindors, and sent his feet straight to the Great Hall, where a delicious lunch was already waiting for him. On the way Ilya had time to exchange a few words with the head of the Scarlet, who was trying to find out what the head of the Ravens liked. Ilya's information desk was open Monday through Friday, and that's why the kid had to give a brief rundown. The Headman, happy but obliged, rushed to make a list of purchases with which he must jam on his next foray into Hogsmeade. By the way, in Hogwarts also worked and clandestine trade, for an extra penny, you could stick money and a list of the Twins, who provided delivery of everything, but an owl to send the creepy. For a percentage, Ilya sometimes discounted Weasley's orders, and that helped him out. As already said - the orphan boy twisted and turned as much as he could, in order to have a better and thicker piece. And a headman in debtor's debt, that's always handy. They could wash out some work, beg for a failing grade, ask to cover a night hike to the lair, and so on. So, from useful people Ilya never took a coin for information.   A boy a couple of years younger, a freshman who had recently turned eleven, walked past Weasel, as always walking with his hands behind his head. Dangling a camera on his chest, Ilya recognized Colin Creevey, the founder of the Shaggy Fan Club. A plan was in the bandit's mind.   - Hey, Colin, wait! - Ilya called out to the boy.   The Gryffiondrian froze, and when he turned around, he suddenly turned pale when he noticed the Slytherin crest. However, the boy stepped back in a jiffy when he saw Ilya. The first years had already received an introduction which spoke about the handsome Slytherin as their own boy and an excellent musician, and even the Best Student.   - Listen, reporter, I got a million-dollar job for you.   - Which one? - the budding photographer immediately perked up.   - Yeah, right on your profile. I need to take some pictures. Can you do that?   - Absolutely!   - Okay. Then look," Ilya took a scroll of parchment from his bag and quickly sketched a map of the third floor, where he circled some walls, and marked a couple of huge paintings with tapestries. - Here. Take pictures of these places from all angles. Preferably an hour or two before you go to bed.   - What do you need it for? - Vulture asked. - There are only walls and nothing else.   - The less you know, the better off you are. Just kidding. Hey, buddy, I owe you one.   - All right," the boy said, panting. - When do you need it?   - Whatever," the boy shrugged. - I don't care if it's for Christmas. I'd have to get all the angles.   - All right.   - Then let's move," smiled Ilya, handing the freshman a homemade map. - I'm not going to get all the goodies.   And the students walked quickly to the Great Hall, whose doors were already open and other students were sitting at the tables. Ilya winked at the paparazzi and went to the snake table. There he immediately made himself some soup and put a portion of macaroni and cheese and pork ribs for a hot meal. Of course, Ilya could not tell about the purpose of the task to the first man. After all, you're not going to explain to him that you're busy searching for the gates of Eden - the common women's shower room. Last year Ilya figured out the most likely location of this park of wonders and now all that was left was the smallest thing - to find the entrance. And here the best thing to do was to use the "second hands", which the reporter and his pictures would so conveniently serve as.   While Ilya was diligently devouring his food, loading his stomach to the full, tired sophomores began to enter the hall. Neville and Pineapple Hair stood out in particular. Snape seemed to be giving them a thorough last scolding. The tall-haired one seemed to be working out the syllabus for the lesson, carefully spelling out when and to whom to slip the shit on the top of his head. It's a sort of a syllabus, with Potter's name on the tenth minute and a speech crossed out ten times. Probably rehearsing in front of a mirror too, the bastard personality. He was not much concerned about that, Ilya, as long as he didn't touch Weasel.   The first year Slytherin sat down at the table, diligently skirting around the dirty girl. There had been some changes here, by the way. Not among the male half, of course, Nott, Malfoy, and the two dorks stuck together as usual, but there had been a split among the ladies. Now the "hotter" Blaise and the "redder" Greengrass, were keeping apart. But Tracy Davis, a rather pretty, petite girl with a snub nose, had joined forces with Parkinson and Millicent. Ilya had this situation figured out in no time. Davis used to look presentable enough next to the two hotties, but now, after the summer, she'd become something of an ugly friend. That's why she switched camps, where she could still feel pretty. Oh, those girls.   - Look at the messy messenger," Malfoy's mocking voice sounded. - I think this is the first time I've seen food since summer.   - Yeah, the Weasleys were grass-feeding him," Nott agreed. - He was losing weight.   - No," Zabini waved her hand. - I don't know," Zabini waved. "I'm sure they've been fattening Potter up, he's more promising than Ilya.   - Right," Draco nodded, flipping back his abnormally long bangs. The gesture almost made Parkinson squeal. As the elders at the orphanage would have said, "Soaking wet.   And what do you think, Ilya took up the bayonet defense and flooded the table with his vulgar and dirty taunts and jabs. Not at all. The young man calmly finished his prime rib, finished his orange juice, and, packing his bags, bolted out of the hall. The somewhat dumbfounded classmates followed him with angry glances.   Ilya smirked maliciously. As sharp as his outbursts were, total disregard was far more effective when dealing with pompous and glossy aristocrats. How dare some filthy noble dare ignore them. Ilya was satisfied with his new plan. All that was left was the finishing touch, but that wasn't until next week. After Weasel was done, no ass wearing a green crest would dare open their mouths in the direction of their classmate. Oh yeah, it'll be a total and unconditional victory. Or total and irrevocable failure, but he who doesn't risk it is a fool.   Weasel pulled out the schedule sheet and sighed a little dejectedly. This year would not be rich in communication. All classes, with the exception of UZMS theory and Astronomy, will be held together with the Vultures. Which means no raven jokes, and no badger jokes. Trouble. What does the board of trustees even think they're doing with the timetable? That Slytherin and Gryffindor, after a year of feuding for centuries, would suddenly become friends? Well, of course it is possible, if Malfoy and Potter would die on the same day, then there would finally be a truce between the faculties. But as long as those two are breathing, it's not gonna happen.   Ilya strode confidently towards the exit of the castle. Two pairs of Herbology were waiting for them after lunch, after which the school day was over. There were already plans for the evening, and that was why the boy had prudently left his guitar in Flitwick's study. By the way, the old master of spells decided to protect his bar in a very clever trick, he simply left the key to his office with Ilya. Now even a seasoned outlaw had no hand to steal anything from any part of the goblin, it would be tantamount to treason. And no one would dare say that Grebert Ilya had ever betrayed anyone. Yeah, you can't argue with life experience, Master Charms made the kid look clean.   It was nice outside; it wouldn't be cold anytime soon, maybe closer to mid-November. So I was able to enjoy the nice days when the sun wasn't too hot, but I didn't even think about wearing a jacket or anything thicker than a T-shirt. If only the robes had been abolished, the whole resort would have been. Reaching the greenhouses, which were closed for the time being, the lad sat down on the grass, leaning his back against the glass and took out another novel from his bag. This time it was an adventurous one, which told about a dashing treasure hunter. The book was full of gunfights, chases, mysteries, and, of course, humor and a great sense of light. All in all, just the right thing to distract and entertain. Ilya was so engrossed in reading that he did not notice the bell ringing, and only Seamus's holler made him, with a slight regret, close the literature and return to the real world.    The chubby but always hospitable Madam Sprout reminded the boys that they would need dragon-skin aprons for this lesson. Ilya slapped himself on the forehead and hoped he hadn't forgotten it, but he didn't. The gloves, like the apron, were in his bag. The boy immediately threw off his robe and donned his work clothes. He was the only one who removed the cloak; the rest had only the apron over them. He just shrugged his shoulders and stood next to McDougal, who smiled at him. In front of the auditorium, standing next to the long standing ones, were pots and some kind of grass in them.   - So, ladies and gentlemen," the herbalist began her lecture. - Today we are going to get acquainted with a wonderful and magical plant. The history of this fascinating sprout, has its origins in the distant past, in Ancient Greece, where it was used as a cure for most diseases, but because of its rarity and too strong action, magicians had to search for other types of healing plants and medicines. We can say that it was thanks to this creation that healing was born, which has become, in consequence, what we have now. So. Who can tell me what it's called?   Hermione's hand fluttered up into the air, tiptoeing up to be noticed. No one else reached out; they were either too lazy or didn't know. Though, no, there was a blushing Longbottom waving his stump timidly. No, Neville should be the master of the order of house children, he even outdid the shaggy one in his shyness.   - I see the summer hasn't gone to waste for you," the professor smiled weakly. - Mr. Ilya, any guesses?   - Um," the guy pretended to think. - I hazard a guess-aspirin?   A chuckle swept through the audience.   - Ilya," Pomona frowned. - I'm asking you seriously.   - Then Mandrake.   - Well done! Three points for Slytherin. Will someone tell me more about her? Oh, Miss Granger, please.   Danger immediately lit up and took a small step forward, as if stepping into the podium.   - Ma'am. Mandrake has been known to humans since 832 BC. It usually grows in the foothills, near streams. Used for many potions, it's also known among Muggles, who consider it a mythical cure-all. The leaves of the plant itself, have no properties, but serve as a mark of identification. They determine the location of the root by the blade of grass bunched in seven places. Young mandrake does not possess very strong medicinal properties but it can stun the digger with a piercing scream. That's why digging the root also involves danger...   Hermione was clearly about to continue her little report, but she was stopped by the professor.   - Excellent! - Sprout exclaimed. - Wonderful! Ten points for Gryffindor!   Danger turned, found Ilya's gaze, and then turned away with a proud twist of her nose. Ilya was dumbfounded as to why, and then it dawned on him. The nerd had decided to have a points race with him or something. Fine. The report card only includes grades for tests and quizzes anyway. For which the owner of a brown mane would get a "B", but Ilya never saw anything lower than a "P" on his report card.   - Today we will try to transplant the young seedlings into pots where they will mature," Sprout held up some fluffy headphones and everyone saw exactly the same ones in front of their eyes. - So, covering your ears tightly with the protective headphones, pull the mandrake sharply out of the pot, then, planting it in a new one, cover it with earth as quickly as possible - to keep it from freezing. Here we go.   Ilya hesitated a little and didn't have time to secure his headphones in time as everyone around him yanked from the sprouts of plants. Ilya had already prepared for unconsciousness or something, but nothing happened. There was no screaming, just some otherworldly merry laughter emitted by the little humonoid creatures. They were having fun and trying to pinch the students' fingers, one even succeeded - Malfoy was a little too giddy. Ilya shrugged and pulled the seedling out in literally a second and immediately placed it carefully in the pot, which he carefully covered with earth, then special fertilizer, and then down to the flower again with earth. As he took his hand away, he was momentarily shown a blade of grass encircling his finger, but it was probably just the wind stirring.   When the class had finished with the seedlings, they went to the very end of the greenhouse, where there were desks among the plants, as usual, littered with grass and some kind of bugs. Sometimes, when taking a lecture, if you added a little imagination, you could imagine yourself sitting in a jungle. But, most likely, it suffered only from Ilya, because the rest were concerned about midges and ground dust. Bugs and mosquitoes never bothered Ilya, it was as if they didn't notice him, circling him in a wide arc. The Slytherin himself simply saw no need to exterminate them, since he had never seen them up close. As it turned out, the best student only knew about creepers through hearsay. Back in the orphanage, knowing the peculiarity of her friend, Rosie liked to joke that Ilya's attitude to buzzards was comparable to the attitude of believers in God. He had never seen them himself, but he believed they were there. The boy always reasonably pointed out that he knew they were there, and that made him different from the fanatics. Despite his visits to church and friendship with a Slavic priest, Ilya himself never believed in higher beings. After entering Hogwarts he became certain there was no God. Although there were Muggleborns at school who had a different point of view, but it was a private matter of one's own volition what to believe in and what not.   Two hours of herbology flew by, and Ilya again gathered up his monks, without putting on his robe, and slipped out of the greenhouses. He had to go upstairs, to the den, where he was going to spend the whole evening and, perhaps, part of the night. There was so much to do, it was even getting creepy. He had to study Transfiguration, study ZoT, work on Numerology and Runes, then there was iron practice, and of course a couple of chapters on Charms as a small encouragement. Weasel, just thinking about it, almost wept, so much to do, and the sun is already so and high. And why do wizards not live on Mars?   September 12, 1992 Hogwarts, Transfiguration Room       Wednesday, the most dangerous day of the week. It's the middle of the week. It would seem that two school days are behind you, but there are three more days ahead, and you don't know if you're getting closer to the weekend or if you're still far away. Here, as in the case with the glass, it all depends on the point of view. Many students are still puzzling over this issue, while Ilya considered Wednesday of this school year, a blessed day. Breakfast was followed by two pairs of Transfiguration, then lunch and a pair of ZOTI, followed by two pairs of Char. One day and three applied subjects at once for a total of five and a half hours. What could be better? Only a change of instructor in transfiguration, but that's in the realm of tabloid fiction.   Standing in front of his office, waiting for the Iron Lady, the boy was literally all over the place. Fleetwyck had dopes with the elders in his office today, on an even week, before lunch, so he had to bring his guitar with him. Bandana boy wore some bracelets, made for him by a sixth-grader from Hufflepuff, on the left wrist (sleeves of robes and shirts were securely rolled up to the elbow), flaunted lanyards presented by Rosie. Behind his belt, a scarlet wand with a scroll-like ornament stuck out like a revolver. He didn't know what those curls were, so he assumed they were tongues of flame. Well, with his right hand he flicked his lighter, doing various tricks he'd learned at the orphanage. In general, being among the humble and even sleek sophomores, Ilya looked like the rabble from the darkest corners of Skary Square. One look at him and the adults would start to cringe, recognizing the scum and the bully, but the wizard seemed to get a kick out of it.   - So you're not going to tell us what you're up to? - I'm not going to tell us what you're up to," he said.   - What makes you think I'm up to something?   - You've just been walking around snickering evilly looking at the Slytherins for a week now," MacDougal remarked reasonably.   - I'm not giggling," Ilya pouted. - I'm practicing the malicious laugh of an evil genius.   - What?" purebreds Brown and Patil stretched out.   - I'll explain later," Isabelle waved her friends off and turned to her classmate. - Will you tell me about it?   - You'll find out for yourself when the time comes.   - You just tell me right away - will it be as big as last year's Mourning Week?   Ilya suddenly froze, and then stretched his lips in a pirate grin, just waiting to be boarded by some schooner.   - Ohhhh," he stretched out. - This is going to be something spectacular. The school would never forget it anyway.   - Anyway? - LaWanda looked up. - What do you mean? Are you going to be a Potter-style hero? I think I'm going to be bored out of our minds without you," he said.   - Oh, so that's how it is," the young man sniffed pretently. - I'm like a clown to you... Well, thank you.   - Ha-ha," Brown mocked the blonde. - Very funny.   - I tried, really," Ilya squeaked. - He was in the middle of the night, but he was still in the middle of the night.   - He's cute and he's a great guy," McDougal smiled, quickly pecking the guy on the cheek. It was a small gesture that made most of the guys present jealous. None of them could communicate as freely with the female gender. Except Malfoy, but he had his own reasons and peculiarities. - Weasel, why don't you call me "Belle" anymore?   Ilya couldn't answer that question. It was just that, after watching that cartoon over the summer, that name, Belle, had become something special to the Slytherin, something you couldn't just call a mate. It was too magical, too beautiful, and too desirable. The girls were clearly waiting for an answer and the boy feverishly began to think of some funny answer, but the situation was saved by McGee. She appeared from around the corner, flashing her emerald robe, and quickly unlocked the doors of the study, letting the people inside. Potter and Weasley were, as usual, late for their first lesson, and while last year the professors had started the class immediately, now they preferred to wait a few minutes so they wouldn't be interrupted at the halfway point. Points from this couple for non-compliance with the rules flew off just like that. Every morning, as soon as the door opened after the bell, you could hear "Potter, Weasley, minus two points each!   The students entered the classroom and Ilya hoped that by the end of the class, the girls would have forgotten about the question. They simply did not want to answer. Ilya was about to go to his gallery, but ran into the Dean of Scarlet and realized everything, he staggered over to Granger. She was already covered in parchments, spare quills and textbooks, as if she was going to build a defensive bunker out of her desk. She might as well plant a rifle in her desk right now and shoot the Slytherins. The girl obviously needed a good dose of hormones.   The professor, without even sitting down at her desk, turned to the door and brought the clock closer to her eyes. After the second minute there was a neat squeak of unlubricated hinges and the redhead woke into the classroom.   - Potter, Weasley, minus two points each!   Ilya hummed, causing a wave of annoyance from Bore, who at the same time managed to hiss at her friends and scribble something on parchment. Bloody hell, it's like Caesar in a skirt. The redhead and the shaggy-haired one quickly ducked back somewhere, where Weasley began whispering softly over his wand, which was thoroughly taped over with magic tape. Chuckles were heard from the Slytherins' side, and Ilya tried to move further away. Weasley was almost Longbottom in terms of workplace accidents as it was, and then there was the broken tool. There was no way he was going to get hurt, no, Ilya cared about life.   - Silence," McGonagall said sternly, and the class fell silent. Of course, the old girl hardly ever takes points off of Gryffindors, but they're still scared of her. The rest of the group was absorbed by the old girl's enthusiasm for the idea of the school, and it was only a matter of time before she got to Snape's side of the family. And if Ilya pulls a stunt, there's no need to explain. - Today you and I are starting a new topic - transmutation of the living into the nonliving. That is a higher level, than the transformation of non-living matter into another non-living matter. It will require a higher level of attention and effort on your part. Now, who can tell me the difference between transmutation of living to non-living matter and transmutation of non-living to non-living matter?   As always, only a few people raised their hands, and, understandably, Hermione Granger. Ilya only frowned and rested his chin on the palm of his hand. Danger, with eagerness, was bouncing and shaking the whole desk. Ilya had already managed to mentally curse both his roommate and her dean. And there, somewhere behind him, waited the coveted galley, where it was so comfortable to lie down.   - Please, Miss Granger," McGee pronounced, not surprisingly.   Even if the whole class suddenly raised their hands, she'd still ask the Nerd, well, or the other griffin. And with the Slytherins, she would only ask Crabbe and Goyle during fits of bad temper, and she always took a few points off them. That Snape and McGonagall were both a pair of boots. Except that the Dean of Scarlet acts in a feminine way, that is, subtly and not very explicitly, but if you look closely...   - Transfiguration of a living object into a nonliving object is difficult because in fact the wizard must rebuild the whole system, investing in the charms much more power. Regarding the other branch - transfiguration of inanimate into animate, it is somewhat easier, because in the latter case, the object is not given the qualities of the living, but on the contrary - for a time are taken away. Spells use an elementary, one-part formula and a two-part swing that forms the main operand of the general level.   Granger literally quoted verbatim from the textbook, which was part of the "attached literature" (i.e. not part of the compulsory curriculum), causing Illya to almost laugh out loud. The girl faltered and looked confused at McGonagall, who was already beginning to blush with anger and indignation.   - Mr. Ilya!" the Iron Lady gritted through her teeth. - Did you bring up the joke again? - The old lady referred to last year's incident.   - No, not at all," the risen boy smiled. - But if you want, I can tell you... I can see that you don't.   - Then what is it?   - It was just that Miss Granger had mentioned some words in her speech that made me uncomfortable.   - Like what?   - An elementary, one-part formula. A two-component sweep. A formative principal operand and, if memory serves me correctly, a general equation. So, I'm very curious if Ms. Granger can explain these terms and their impact on the question.   - Does Miss Granger have anything to explain to you? - McGonagall squinted.   Ilya, as always, played skillfully on bluffs and poker strategy. Adults do not like to learn from their mistakes.   - Of course not," the boy said guiltily, hiding his eyes. - I apologize for my behavior.   The boy sat back in his seat, happily watching the bewildered girl blush. Well, well, she's going to have another go at him. He had enough problems of his own, and the Slytherin didn't need a nerdy girl pestering him with a fake competition.   McGonagall acted exactly as the boffo had intended. Adults...   - Miss Granger, would you explain these terms to the audience?   The girl paled, her hands trembling, but she still ventured to speak. Too proud, too predictable.   - I'll give it a shot. An elementary formula, means the charms aren't laden with complicated accents and lots of...   Before the girl could finish her sentence, Ilya laughed out loud, not even pretending. He literally laughed, holding his stomach and his desk at the same time. Hermione's lips trembled and her eyes moistened, but she held on. And Ilya had already started tapping his fist on the table, causing everyone's bewilderment.   - Mr. Ilya!" the Dean of Scarlet barked, glaring at the boy like an angry mother. Apparently offended for her ward. - Stop it immediately, or I'll take away all the points of your department!   The boy calmed down, adjusted his bandanna, and wiped away the tears of laughter.   - Stand up, Mr. Ilya.   The guy got up.   - Now explain to us what makes you laugh all the time.   - Granger," the boy answered honestly. - He was talking such nonsense, I just couldn't help myself.   - Minus twenty points for rudeness! - McGonagall barked. - Sit down Miss Granger, thirty points for an excellent answer. And you, Mr Ilya, I didn't say you could sit down! Would you care to explain the terms your classmate mentioned to us?   - No bazaar," Ilya shrugged, and didn't let McGonagall take any more points off him. - When the phrase "elemental formula" is used, it says that when performing a function, the mage does not need to utter a non-verbal component to himself. This is what distinguishes formulas in the three types - elementary, simple, and standard. In the case of the one-word formula, what is really meant is that only one word is necessary, but in the case of the one-word formula, it is a natural churn. Heh-heh-heh. Ahem. So. A two-part swing, does not at all imply two patterns, as some might have thought... In this case, it refers to using a pattern and a small rune of transformation. And finally, the "main operand." I don't know what Granger wanted to say about it, but the emphasis here is on the sweep. That is, it is the leader in this dance. If the mage messes up the pronunciation a bit, but gets the swing and the rune drawing right, he'll do well, because he's the swing, dragging the magic behind him. And what makes me laugh is that Granger is like an audio book - she seems to speak correctly, but doesn't understand a damn thing herself. And you're giving her points for it.   - But we didn't go through with it! - The girl shrieked.   - You bet," the boy shrugged. - It's material from Numerology and Runes.   - Mr. Ilya," McGee hissed. - Are you trying to teach me how to teach?   - No, I don't think so," the boy shook his head. - I don't really care how or what you teach.   A ringing silence hung in the classroom, people couldn't believe that Ilya had made it this far in his war with the Dean of Scarlet. Even the Slytherins stuck up and watched the unfolding spectacle.   - "Come on, come on, come on, you old mop," Ilya mentally pleaded.   - A month's work!   - "Oh yes, baby!" - still mentally exulted the boy when the plan was a complete success. - "Tea and biscuits, I'm coming to you! "   - Ilya, if you don't turn this mouse into a goblet this instant," it seemed that add more fire, and McGee would explode like C4. - I assure you, I will do everything in my power to make sure that you never forget this conversation in your life.   - No bazaar," the boy repeated.   He carefully waved his wand, said the right formula, and instead of a white mouse on the professor's desk appeared glittering with gold (just yellow coating) and precious stones (glass), a goblet styled like a skull. The girls shrieked. Ilya, on the other hand, felt weakness in his legs and heard a ringing in his ears. Too much magic had gone into this feint. No, transfiguration was not his thing; let the magic jocks do it, if they had to turn something into something, create something out of thin air. Ilya wasn't interested in that at all.   - Adis," the slightly swaying young man said in silence, slipping his guitar case over his shoulders and walking out, slamming the door deafeningly, shattering the stained glass window for the umpteenth time. At those moments, Ilya could not understand Potter better, who, after his Potions lessons, was ready to rip the throat out of anyone who looked at him obliquely with his bare hands. Even Malfoy didn't touch the bespectacled boy in those moments - the weakling's instinct for self-preservation had not yet atrophied.   Ilya, not to waste time, went outside, where he was going to plunge back into the never-read adventure novel. The boy, descending the stairs in an empty castle, still felt some anticipation before ZOTI. Still, it was his first time with the Vulture Defence, even though it would be led by some murky type. According to the schedule, the classes should have started last week, but Lokahrt said that he was furnishing his office for the classes, so he would not be able to start before the eleventh. Ilya has always been able to admit his mistakes, though it was quite unpleasant, so he thought that with such an approach to business, the writer might turn out to be a very tolerable teacher. However, time will tell, and the book does not wait.   A few hours later, Hogwarts, ZoT room.       - That was your extravaganza? - Lavender asked a little disappointed, alluding to the Iron Lady incident.   - No, of course not! - indignantly, Ilya, than elicited a slight wave of giggles. - It was light foreplay.   - You know you're impossible? - Brown sighed, wiggling what at her age could not yet be wiggled.   - I'm told that quite often," the boy smiled.   At that time, the doors of the office opened and the scent of wild flowers wafted in from the room. It was as if someone had spilled a whole bottle of perfume or toilet water. And it was not of the best quality.   - Let's go in! - Lockahrt smiled all thirty-two of his own.   The girls exhaled together and groaned lightly. Granger was especially hard at it, it was disgusting to watch. Ilya reasonably thought that on the podium of the most handsome man in school he had a serious rival. However, this, as always, Ilya cared little. Letting the girls forward, holding the door for them, the guy himself went inside. In fact, once inside, he wished to run out of there like out of an oven.   What had Lockhart turned the gloomy ZoT room into, with skulls, skeletons, and pictures depicting the effects of various curses?! Where did he put the atmosphere of darkness and evil? Devil, why the fuck are there pink tulle on the windows and the same tone curtains. Why are there hundreds of pictures of Gilderoy smiling from literally every scrap of free space on the walls, there are even a couple of full-length ones. Why the devil are his credentials, awards, and magazine covers in glass frames hanging right above the professor's desk. And Ilya still allowed himself to doubt this faggot. This is a natural nightmare, not a teacher of some sort, conditionally martial magic. He's a real nightmare, not a teacher of some kind of martial magic.   Ilya, as if in a trance, walked to the gallery and sat down at the table. The first desks were firmly occupied by girls, including the Slytherin girls. Behind the ladies sat frowning boys. Ilya didn't want to take any chances, so he didn't look at the expression on Malfoy's face, there was little chance there would be what should be on the blonde's face in the presence of a "colleague". Ilya wouldn't stand for that and would very likely say goodbye to dinner, and that was not to be.   The professor's speech followed, which lasted for a good quarter of an hour. In it Lockhart advertised his books, in his words - monuments of fiction, then he remembered and demonstrated all the awards he had received, including "The Best Smile" according to "Witchpolitan". Ilya then breathed a sigh of relief. If it had been awarded by the New Salem Times, the leading newspaper in the magical society, then you could consider the world just fucked... Then Gilderoy, completely overlapped, began to broadcast about how great he was and in fact even Dumbledore himself sometimes asked him for advice. Yeah, and Merlin's ghost flies in to chat about this and that. He was a bit of a wanker, but he had to be careful about what he said, so he was not going to say anything about it.   - Who will help me with the distribution of the forms? - in a lusciously sweet voice, flashing a smile, asked Lokahrt.   All the girls present immediately threw their hands in the air. The scribe spent some time picking out who would help him, and finally pointed to Blaise and Daphne. The Slytherins, proud and beaming, fluttered up and grabbed the sheets of parchment the same hour. In literally a dozen seconds, they managed to go around the entire class and hand out the slips, bestowing some sort of grimace on everyone. Illya got a scornful sneer.   The young man quickly ran his eyes over the text, then again, and again. Ilya put the questionnaire aside, took a deep breath, pinched his arm, and looked at the questions again. Then looked again, and again. After that, Ilya, without saying a word, gathered his things, threw his guitar on his shoulders and quietly moved towards the exit.   - Young man," Gilderoy called out to him.   The guy pretended not to hear and lowered his hand to the knob, turning it slowly.   - Young man! - There was a muffled cry behind the closed doors behind the Slytherin.   Ilya moved upstairs, toward Flitwick's office. Still hovering somewhere in the astral, the fucking kid couldn't believe that such assholes really existed in this world. This is the apogee of cretinism and retardation, as such are born in general. And, in that case, who gives birth to them?!      * * *   Ilya, sitting on the sixth floor in the Charms Professor's office, was reading his textbook on the Runes. Numerology was moving too tightly so far, and the guy, not used to banging his forehead against stone walls, decided to change his focus for now. He was nearly finished learning the minor alphabet in Runes. There were only some seventy-eight characters left, after which he could move on to the older ones, which are the most important components in compiling your own spell. Ilya, by his own estimation, estimated that he would be able to create his first spell around the middle or end of the third year. Unless, of course, some curiosity occurred and the boy lost all his mental faculties, which, given the current situation, was a likely outcome.   Ilya was so engrossed in his research that he did not notice how a good-natured dwarf entered the spacious, bright room.   - Oh, Ilya, I knew I'd meet you here," greeted the boy in his mocking tone.   Ilya, without lifting his head from his textbook, suddenly quoted:   - Regulation 49 of 1013, in its modern interpretation, states - "A student is obliged to attend all control, interim and final checks in the subject. There is no word in the rules about the attendance of the classes themselves. So my foot will not be in ZOTI class.   - A very sensible solution," Flitwick nodded. A dazed Ilya looked up. - I heard that in class Mr. Lockhart unleashed the formidable, deadly Cornish pixies, who were having quite a bit of fun with the students.   - How horrible! Didn't the great Mr. Smiley strike these monsters down with his most powerful spells?   - I'm afraid Mr. Lockhart was disarmed by one of the, as you put it, monsters, throwing the teacher's wand out the window.   - How scary it is to live...   - You don't say," Flitwick pursed his lips in a sneer. - I heard a rumor that you've already had a month's pay.   - It just happened," the boy shrugged.    - I'm sure you will. I don't want to upset you, but you'll have to visit me on Thursday and Saturday, starting this Saturday, from seven o'clock at night until lights out. Now, if you don't want to miss my lesson, you'd better hurry.   - Is that a challenge? - The young man arched an eyebrow.   - Do you think you can outrun me? - Question after question, Filius answered.   - Won't you fall apart halfway through?   - How rude.   With those words, the spell master literally vanished, disappearing into the corridor.   Ilya ran to the office by the time the bell rang. He was blushing a little, and he wasn't exactly breathing easily. Running through the forest was always easy and free, but running through the castle was crushing and tiring, but Flitwick had overtaken the lad and arrived at the finish line before the bell even rang. At that, the old man looked like a pickle, and even his robe wasn't disheveled. How that was possible, the lad didn't even try to understand.   The Slytherins and Gryffindors had already gathered in the classroom, trying to burn each other with glances. Weasley and Malfoy were especially eager. The boy, catching his breath (the stairs, as usual, were all trying to either confuse the lad or swat him away altogether), walked into the study. The charmer looked at him with a slight superiority, winked at him, and waved his hand vaguely in the air. With that, the old man indicated that since the boy had lost, he now owed him. The boy twitched. The last time he'd lost a bet to a professor, he'd had to make his way to the Astronomy Tower at midnight, up to the roof, to quack five times. Yeah, the dwarf knew a lot about humour and banter and childishness. He was a creepy guy...   - Come in, Mr. Ilya," the teacher said, hurrying the boy along. - Or do you need Madam Pomfrey's help? Not falling apart?   - Touch, touch," the Slytherin raised his hands in a conciliatory gesture, and to the general bewilderment of the class, made his way to his favorite spot in the castle. After the hill by the woods, of course.   Here, at the very top of the amphitheatre, near the huge, full-wall, impenetrable window, the boy sat almost alone. But at the same time, he felt himself on the rise. If it got boring, which was the rarest of episodes in the dwarf's classes, he could always look out at the slightly beckoning forest. At school it was called the Forbidden Forest for some reason, but the well-read boy called it the Magic Forest. Ilya thought that if the forest had a choice, it would surely prefer the name Ilya, if, it - the forest - didn't already have a name of its own. But maybe he wouldn't give up his nickname then? Ilya, for example, has a nickname - Weasel. You might think that the boy made it up himself, but if you listen carefully, it is clear that the nickname first came off the tongue of Flitwick, who literally attached it to the young man.   He sighed, his blue eyes sparkling, and continued to stare out the window. The treetops swayed gently and he could literally hear the distant, soft whispers of the trees, merging the voices of the wind and the beasts. The forest was never silent, even at night, it always whispered something, almost lulling him to sleep in his green cradle. And also different animals lived in the forest. The boy had seen many in the summer, but he supposed there must be some wonders in the Enchanted One. Unicorns there, or even griffins, or maybe pegasi. It would be interesting to ride a pegasus...   - Colleagues, today I have prepared an amazing spell," the professor began his lecture, having previously climbed on a stack of books. - As you probably already know, people always lack something. Some need grace and subtlety, some need charm and beauty, and some need a big sword in its sheath. And now imagine such a situation. You're sitting in a bar, sipping whis... juice, and a bad man comes up to you and starts hitting on the lady. And in hands at you a ball pen or a pencil, what to do - ask you? You can't do magic in front of Muggles. That's where today's spell will help. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to welcome our new, indispensable companion in various disputes - enchantment to increase!   Flitwick waved his hands and the shades fell from the board, revealing complex formula calculations, examples of swings, drawings, and the formula itself, "Engorgio. Ilya's eyes flashed with anticipation. These spells he had mastered at the beginning of this summer and quite a long time dabbled with them, increasing everything in sight. Huge chairs, on which a giant could collapse, slices of bread, the size of a table (to eat them, though. Not recommended. In the stomach to shrink, then you'll spend the whole day with a white friend), and many other things, subjected to increase. Mice the size of dogs, sparrows that look like pterodactyls, and so on and so forth.   Suddenly Ilya came across a flaming, enthusiastic and not-so-encouraged Ronald. The boy, choking on air, slumped under the desk and began to laugh softly. Surely the redhead had already thought up his own use for this enchantment, only he was going to fail beforehand. The enchantment increase has no effect on humans and most magical creatures. Nor does it work on any object that contains or contains magic. It's not transfiguration...   After a brief introduction, a long but interesting lecture ensued, peppered with jokes and quips, as well as anecdotes and anecdotes. All around creaked feathers, and Ilya grinned triumphantly. Self-writing pen was working for him. Well, even though it used to belong to the overlapped terrorist, after all, the lad had won it in a fair contest.   Towards the end of the lesson, as always, practice was expected.   - Colleagues, in front of you lie our beloved feathers. So, your task is to try to enlarge them at least a little bit by the end of the lesson.   As always, after a peculiar wave, the air in the classroom shook with the wands waving and voices reciting the formula. Ilya already had a plan. What could he do, if the boy liked attention. Maybe it was the years at the orphanage, where he avoided attention so as not to get in trouble on a sensitive spot.   The boy didn't hesitate long before he swiped at the glass with the rib of his lighter. There was a wild squeak and crackle, someone shrieked, but everyone turned to the Slytherin. He wasted no time in turning the quill into a small rubber sword with a single stroke and a simple formula.   - Engorgio! - pronounced Ilya.   Immediately the sword stretched out, increasing in size. In the end, it looked like a regular half-blade, the kind held in its metal hands by every armor standing in the castle.   - Professor, I'd like a rematch," the boy smirked, levitating his blade straight to the teacher's desk.   - I can't refuse you.   The professor, with just a fleeting swing, created an exact replica of the rubber weapon. The battle began. Gerber, concentrating, tried to match the old man in swordsmanship, but each time, somehow, his sword ended up at a disadvantage, and if they weren't mages holding blades in the air, the kid would be left with quite a few bruises from the whipping rubber. Some of the class watched the toy blades and the same battle with interest, most were focused on their feathers, which didn't even think to increase in size.   It was only when the bell rang that Danger's feather changed from a goose's to an ostrich's, in size of course. The girl was pale, her forehead covered with sweat, but she was clearly pleased with herself.   - Excellent, excellent. Mr Ilya, Miss Granger, five points each. The rest of you, don't get frustrated and study more on your own. I'm looking forward to your interesting results and scores. For homework, an essay on the use of these charms in various situations. You are dismissed.   The students left the room saying goodbye to the teacher, who always answered, and to everyone. As a result, the phrase "goodbye" was heard so often that the old professor probably hated it quietly, but didn't show it. Ilya, with a nod to the dwarf, headed for the den, where he was going to spend a couple of hours and then do some training. True, not with iron, but with wood, for the adventure was not waiting!   September 15, 1992, Hogwarts, Quidditch pitch.       It had been a week since the faculty Quidditch team trials had taken place. The excitement was wild. The twins even staged a sweepstakes to see who would make it, and who wouldn't. The Gryffindor squad, as a result of the selections, had no changes to the main roster, only replacements, that's all. Hufflepuffs took a new catcher - Cedric Diggory, a very popular, not stupid guy. Ravenclaw also had a new snitch hunter, with a third-year student replacing Keri Deveney, who had graduated. Her name was something like Chow Chang, a typical Asian half-breed. In the sense that her mom was European. Chang had thick hair, porcelain skin, but rather large eyes that gave her a certain sparkle. The girl was quite popular with the guys. Ilya himself had only exchanged a few phrases with her, and found the lady too plain and boring. She was rather egocentric and liked to talk about herself, her problems and successes, the rest she didn't seem to care much about. Not selfishness, but egocentrism in its most banal form.   As for Slytherin, nothing is yet known. For one thing, the Greens always held the selections "behind closed doors", reserving the stadium through Snape for the whole day. And none of the castle's residents who didn't wear the crest with a snake risked showing up among the rings on the day of the hated faculty's selections. The last one to risk it spent six months among the cauldrons of the Sallow-Haired. The last one to risk it was spent half a day in the cauldrons of the Half-Hair.   Last year, which ended in a Slytherin victory (Potter missed the match while lying in hospital). Back then, the lineup was Marcus Flint, now a sixth year, the head boy, a shouldered guy who had a girlfriend from Ravenclaw, but he was careful to keep it a secret from the rest of the school. Marcus was one of three Hunters. The other two were Graham Montague and Adrian Pusey. Graham was Flint's classmate, but Pusey had graduated last year and the Hunter spot had become vacant.   Peregrin Derrek and Lucian Bowl acted as the corrers. Both were children of the Eaters, who had a bad habit of aiming a bludger at their faces. Legend has it that they were once severely pummeled by the Twins when Bowle hit Spinnet in the face with a bludger. After that, the pair of Hellcats cooled down, but they've still got their bad habits. In the catcher's place was Terrence Higgs, the current sixth year, so subtle and deadpan that he looked more like a third year, but that made him an excellent catcher who had almost beaten Potter last year. Who knew the shaggy-haired one would be his bread-and-butter catching golden ball.   In fact, on this sunny day, in the field, where almost the entire faculty of snakes gathered (for the complete set, lacked only a couple of people who were doing their business in the office, under the spell of Silencing), the selection for the Hunter and the replacement bench was taking place. And, of course, no one expected Ilya to be lurking in the dark alcove, clutching the school's Purgator in his hands. Once it was a very respectable and good broom, but progress does not stand still and now Purgatory is a past age.   Flint, bringing his wand to his throat, uttered:   - Sonorus! &shy;? In the same instant, his voice increased enough to be heard from the stands. - Tonight we select the Hunter. All those who wish to do so, line up.   Then ten people showed up on the field, standing shoulder to shoulder. People were holding different brooms, though not exactly, all had Nimbus from the 1890s to 1975. No one had a 2000, or the newest, 2001. There was only one such broom in the school and it was owned by Potter. On the goal, I mean rings, soared Miles Bletchley, the same permanent Slytherin goalkeeper as Wood was with the Vultures. Flint was about to blow his whistle when another man ran out onto the lawn. A black bandana flashed in the sun, revealing rolled up shirt sleeves and a pirate grin. Ilya, holding a disheveled broom in his hand, stood in formation. The whole stadium, all one hundred and thirteen Slytherins, fell out.   - What are you doing here? - Flint said quietly.   In general, to be frank, most of the Greens simply tried not to notice the Dirtyblood, not hurting him in any way. The only ones who tried to hurt him were the younger ones, up to and including the third year. The older ones got involved only when the situation took a turn for the worse, like last year.   - I came to try it out," Ilya shrugged.   - That's a shitty idea. Get out of here, little man, before I shove a broom up your ass.   - We're supposed to be a democracy," the boy reminded me. - I'll save you some time, though. I'll make you a wager.   - A bet?   - Yep. (chuckles) If I score ten out of ten goals for Bletchley, you take me on the team.   There was whistling and laughter in the bleachers; the guy didn't give a damn. The affair was gaining momentum, and there was no stopping it, once it was dispersed.   - And if I don't? - Flint squinted.   - Then I'll stand up at dinner and loudly declare that the despicable filthy boy isn't worthy of Slytherin. I'll fall to my knees and ask Dumbledore to arrange for my transfer to another wizarding school.   The whistling and laughter immediately ceased, the boy had put it all on the line. Don't think Ilya was a hundred percent sure, more like sixty-five percent sure. But damn it, he's Ilya, Morgana love him, Ilya, the leader of Scary Square's youngest gang! He wouldn't be afraid to go all-in, betting all his chips on just a couple of sixes.   - Ten out of ten? - Flint asked again. The usual practice was five balls, and whoever threw the most, took the vacant spot.   But, if rumors are to be believed, Bletchley has never yet missed more than four on a selection.   - Ten out of ten," the kid nodded.   Marcus pondered for a while, then turned to the bleachers.   - What do you say?! - he asked the audience.   The audience responded with approving clapping and foot stomping. They were all anxious to get rid of the white eyesore. Even the other applicants for the vacancy took a step back, and the goalkeeper was already stretching his neck and shoulders.   - You've signed your own sentence," Flint said as he put his whistle to his mouth.   There was a short, sharp whistle, and Ilya threw his leg over the pole and soared sharply into the air. Soon a quaffle was thrown to him, which the lad caught deftly. A northwest wind was blowing, which meant he had to spin it into the lower ring, which was on the left side. The goalkeeper was focused, he never took Quidditch lightly, and if there was even a one-armed gremlin in front of him, he would take it seriously.   Ilya soared into the air in a friend, he was flying so fast that he soon turned into a dot, then he suddenly began to fall, clutching the ball between his hands. He spun like a sewing spinner, and then, as his figure turned into a blur against the background of the midday sun, then nothing happened. The boy simply stopped at the same level he'd been half a minute ago. Except he didn't have the quaffle in his hands. The goalkeeper didn't understand what was going on, and then he looked around. The ball was in the air behind his basket. The stands fell silent - the first goal. A goal that was impossible for Bletchley to see, but which was closely observed by everyone present. In a dive, when the sun was behind Ilya's back, he tossed the leather ball with such force that it blurred into a brown shadow.   Bletchley, turning around, picked up the quaffle lying in the air and tossed it to the boy, rubbing his shoulder. That was just the beginning, and Ilya himself agreed. He suddenly turned a hundred and eighty and flew in the opposite direction. In the center of the field he turned again, pressed his whole body against the staff and took off. He flew in a straight line without coming up with anything unnecessary. According to the rules of the game, the ball may not be thrown closer than five meters from the rings. And in this very five meters zone, Ilya suddenly shot with his hand and the ball literally teleported to the rings. The second goal...   Half an hour later.   Marcus took a long, attentive look at the weakened Ilya and the tired, flushed Bletchley. A deathly silence hung in the stands for a long time. The sun, hidden behind a cloud, suddenly flashed its ray, revealing the figure of the barefoot from the gloom.   - You're in.   - Heeeeell yeeeaaah!   - Training on Wednesdays and Fridays, - continued the team captain. - If you get a workout on those days, you will regret that you were born.   The gamble was a success...   A few hours later, Flitwick's office.       - Come in, Ilya," the master of spells answered when there was a knock at the door.   The boy immediately slipped into the spacious office, illuminated in the evening by flying magic lights and closed the door behind him. The boy put his guitar on a special stand and sat down across from the professor. The young man glittered like a star that had fallen from the sky. His eyes burned with an unbearably bright, blue fire, and his lips sought to stretch into a dashing smile.   - I see you're pleased," the professor grinned.   The kid nodded, looking like a Chinese dummy.   - Sometimes, it takes a brave enough heart to go up against a mortal enemy. But to put your future and your whole life on the line for nothing... You'd have to be either a reckless fool or an insane brave man. I don't know what to make of you, Ilya.   The professor was clearly teasing the boy, because it was obvious that for some part the goblin was pleased and even proud. Ilya himself, because of the emotions overwhelming him, could not even open his mouth, so he just shrugged. Outside the window the moon had long since rolled out, illuminating everything with a measured, shimmering silver light. The stars shone brightly, and the lowly clouds floated like cruise liners, parting the black velvet of the sky.   - Anyway, let's go, Mr. Ilya.   The professor rose and moved toward the window, the boy followed. The dwarf stopped in front of the knight's armor that stood in the corner of the study, then the master of enchantments reached out his hand and swung the cross-shaped sword's guard as if it were a simple valve. The armor suddenly shuddered, then bowed low as if alive and took a step to the side, revealing the dark march behind it.   Flitwick silently kindled a light at the tip of his wand and stepped boldly into the darkness, followed by the young men. They descended the spiral staircase for some time, dark and cobweb-covered with the occasional howl of wind from the vents and vents. Then, when the stairs ended, Ilya found himself in a long corridor. With each step, torches were lit on the walls. With a loud "Pshash," they suddenly began to shine unbearably bright, literally blinding the wizard. But Flitwick steadily led them somewhere else. He spotted a door once in a while, but it reeked of a protective charm a mile away. He'd never been in this part before.   - Where are we going, Professor? - Weasel finally asked.   - Straight," Flitwick shrugged, but clarified nonetheless. - Have you forgotten our wager and the pleasant surprise awaiting you? And, frankly, I can't really allow you to slack off on Zoote.   The boy was beginning to guess about something, but here they were already stopped in front of huge doors that resembled the doorways of the Great Hall. The professor stepped forward and swiped his overly long fingernail on the barn lock hanging on the massive doors. There was a gnash of teeth, and the lock literally soaked into the doors. Those, a moment later, opened.   The wizard waved his hand and the glowing orbs began to burst out of his wand and went up to the high ceiling, where they twirled in a circle, pouring down the bright light. It was indeed a huge hall. For the most part, it was almost empty. But there was a long, wide platform in the center, and in the corners were various targets and, oh Mordred, the very dummies that flaunted in Weasel's den.   Flitwick beckoned the boy and pointed to the platform. The boy, guessing everything, drew his wand and moved towards him. As the boy made his way up the stairs to the platform, Flitwick spoke in an unusually serious, almost unhinged voice:   - Mr. Ilya," said the master of spells in a stern, heavily carcassed and squeaky voice, as never before. - I'm not going to teach you any spells, I'm not going to show you any special tricks, explain tactics, strategy, and other tricks. I'm not in the habit of wasting my time with mediocrity and mediocrity. If you have it, if you have a talent for battle, it will reveal itself, and we will continue to fight. If not, don't judge, but we will finish it over a cup of tea and a vase of cookies. I repeat, I will not teach you anything, but I will throw you out of the nest and fly near, hoping that you will spread your wings and soar to the sky.   The boy nodded and raised his wand. The little professor did the same, as if he had grown to the size of a mythical giant.   - Defend yourself, Ilya. And God help you.          It was dark outside, but there was a heavy silence in the relatively small house by the woods. Not the silence that was about to burst into laughter, girls' squeals, and clattering toasts, but a real silence. Which like cotton wool clogs your ears, penetrates into every corner and every crevice. The same silence that makes even the light seem dimmer and people more sad. Only once in a while was the silence interrupted by the strained squeak of Ron puking. But the spell had all but worn off by now, and that sound came once every ten minutes at most. It was like a drop of honey in a barrel of tar and tar was silence.   Hagrid was silent because he didn't know what to say, he was a good-natured man, but sometimes he couldn't find the right words and so he didn't speak at all. Potter was silent because he had just found out something he would rather not know. Danger was silent because she was reminded of something she wished she could forget. Ronald was silent because he was throwing up.   In that viscous, sticky silence, like thunder in a clear sky, there was a distinct knock on the door. Everyone flinched, and Hagrid smiled tautly and turned the massive, heavy knob. On the threshold, in the light of the oil lamp, stood a tall lad. Two months ago, he'd seemed to have lost weight, but in that time, thanks to iron and dense food, he'd gained weight again. His green Quidditch uniform was filthy and its hem had turned into a tattered mess. But the boy didn't care - a couple of household charms and the cloak would be good as new.    - Ilya," the forester smiled at the boy. - And what are you doing here?   - I'm on business," the boy replied seriously.   - You've picked the wrong moment," the half-giant shook his head, but let the bosota in.   The boy was immediately met with angry looks from Scarlet. Potter clutched the wand that lay in his lap, Hermione's lips trembling again. Ronald, spitting up a slug, went red with barely contained rage. Ilya knew he wasn't welcome here.   - You fools," he shook his head. He quietly drew a small vial of silver liquid from a secret pocket he had sewn into himself, and then placed it on the table. - Drink this," he said to Ronald. - You'll feel better.   - What is it," Hermione said warily.   - Of course it's poison," Ilya hummed. - It's a Cancellation Potion. Ten times more potent than Finita. It would take away the symptoms and the effects.   With those words, the boy rubbed the shaggy Fang, and turned toward the door. The shaggy-haired one caught up with him.   - Why are you helping us?   Ilya turned and sighed heavily, running a hand over his face.   - I'm not helping you. I'm just trying to follow the lessons of a certain dwarf. Ronald, knowing his weapon was broken, tried to stand up for his friend. It was dangerous for him in the first place. But he wasn't afraid. It's a dignified act that should be respected.   The boy flicked Fang's nose, which growled funny, and tried to leave the hut again, but he was called out for the second time. This time it was Hermione.   - How do you handle it?    Ilya turned around and arched a puzzled right eyebrow.   - With being called a filthy... filthy girl all the time.   Everyone in the cabin shuddered except Ilya, who just shrugged.    - A tree does not need to be offended when it is called a tree. Because the tree knows that it is a tree, and it is quite content with that.   Weasel finally emerged from the hut. He yawned widely, threw his broom on his shoulder, and strode towards the castle. The training was exhausting, and Malfoy's presence made it even more exhausting.             October 31, 1992. Hogwarts              Ilya, stroking his swollen belly, headed for the nearest place where he could get some relief. The feast had been a great one. In any case, this year no one had stopped the boy from devouring everything within reach of his grasping paws. No bloody troll interrupted the stuffing process.    In the bottomless sinkhole named Ilya was gone: a whole bowl of Caesar salad, a dozen cold snacks, two pitchers of juice, three servings of macaroni and cheese and two servings of fried potatoes, two escalopes, two servings of ribs, two servings of chicken wings, a portion of fried breasts. But you don't think Weasel sacrificed dessert, no, it also shoved it in itself. How all this fit into the kid is a question all British scientists, famous for their discoveries, are still puzzling over.    He turned to the secret staircases, because on a full stomach a run through the main - suicide, weasel realized that perhaps he would shit himself a little before he reached the white friend. No, the boy was not frightened at all, he just felt for a moment something that made him cringe, but the feeling instantly disappeared. It was as if some inconceivably ancient and frightening thing had peeked into the East Wing, but not finding a victim here, turned around in disappointment and whisked away into unreality. That feeling was familiar to Ilya, it meant that a number of someone was almost dead. It meant that death rustled its robes over the ancient stones of the magic castle.    Turning the corner, the boy found himself in a spacious corridor on the second floor, not far from Weeping Myrtle's bathroom. Nothing caught Ilya's attention at first, but then he saw those whose presence in any non-public place meant only one thing - a grim asshole of trouble was once again unfolding at Hogwarts.   The Golden Trio was standing in front of a huge puddle, but they weren't looking at it, they were looking at the wall. The weasel, who was like a little pebble on legs, waddled over to the boys. He glanced at the wall as well, then slapped himself across the face with an audible slap. Ilya had hoped for a relatively quiet year, which he would devote to lessons and music, but wizards didn't seem to know what quiet meant at all.   Soon the clatter of hundreds of feet could be heard in the corridor-the students were returning from the feast and hurrying toward Hog's main artery-the staircases. In just a moment the black sea of robes was rippling around them, trembling with quiet and not-so-silent whispers.   Hanging on the wall was the filch cat, Mrs. Norris. She stretched her paws out unnaturally, as if she were frozen in a silly leap. Her eyes were unblinking and scary in their glassiness. She was bolted by her tail to the torch, which cast a glow on the bloody inscription.   - The Chamber of Secrets has been reopened! Tremble, enemies of the Heir! " read out Draco, and in a voice that sounded like a priest combining royal offspring. Blondie suddenly grinned and turned to Granger. - You're next, filthy girl.   - Whoa! Whoa! - Ilya pretended to sniff the air. - Don't you think it smells like shit in here? Oh, Malfoy, that's your breath... you should at least wash it after parties!   Laughter erupted through the crowd, and Draco turned pale and pressed his lips together again, but then Filch appeared on the scene. He was, as always, in his worn leather coat, with his sparse, disheveled hair and a hunched nose that looked like it was broken in two places.    - What's going on here?! - Filch growled.   His eyes unfocused for a moment, then he froze and literally flew to his cat. The janitor's cheeks glistened, and he began to cry out something faintly. Suddenly, the janitor glared at the stunned Potter and bellowed, rushing over to him.   - It's you, you wretched boy! - he yelled, clutching the bespectacled man's shoulder. - You killed her! I'll have you...   - Argus! - A familiar voice echoed through the castle. The crowd froze, the whispers died down, and the steward released the shaggy-haired man.   From the left arm of the corridor all the teaching staff appeared, led by Dumbledore himself, flashing his bizarre robe, which in no way matched the unusually serious eyes. Weasel shrank inwardly. He did not like the situation. Outwardly, Ilya looked as usual - a defiant, pirate-like grin on his face, and his hands were thrown behind his head. But inside the boy was a real hurricane. He was already regretting having left dinner so early.   - What's going on here? - Dumbledore asked.   Weasel could have sworn that if the headmaster had asked him a question in that tone and the lad would have already started recounting his entire life from his first memory. It was a different Albus, not the kind who would always make him laugh and give him a slice.    - Headmaster," the caretaker started sobbing. - My cat... she's dead, dead. It's him! He killed her!    The principal looked at Mrs. Norris and froze for a moment, only her blue eyes sparkling like fallen stars.    - I doubt it, Argus," Snape hissed, making everyone wince a second time. - That Potter has the skill to kill a mosquito, let alone a cat.   - But...   - She's alive," the Headmaster said calmly, but his voice echoed off the ancient walls in waves. - There is a spell of black magic on her that has made her numb. But she is alive.   - Yes!" exclaimed Locons, flashing his smile and a colorful robe that caused a tear in his eye and a slight nausea. - Headmaster, you literally took it out of my mouth! Just now I wanted to point out myself that Mrs. Norris is alive.   No one paid any attention to the writer. The headmaster looked around and only now seemed to notice that the whole school was crowded in the corridor.   - Headmasters, take the faculties to their living rooms," Albus pronounced.    No one dared to contradict him, and after a moment, the crowd began to disperse. The weasel, too, hurried to get out of the way, but it was no use.   - He was with them! The vile rascal was with them! - shouted the janitor.   - Mr. Ilya, stay," said the headmaster calmly.   Ilya, sighing heavily, returned to the boys. Soon there were only adults and four children standing in the corridor in front of the puddle. Ilya was uncomfortable, he had always avoided the scrutiny of those in power, but now he was literally caught up in it, and from a great distance. Flitwick was the only one who looked at the Slytherin with encouragement, as he always did.    - Harry, my boy, will you tell us what happened?   - Yes, yes! Let him talk! - the superintendent couldn't calm down.   - Director, sir, when we entered the corridor, it was already like this. Honestly! It wasn't us!   - I believe you," Albus nodded.   - Potter," he put his penny to the Potellist, "I haven't seen you since the middle of dinner. How do you explain that? Or did all three of you need to loosen your bellies?   - We were at the Death Jubilee! - Danger answered immediately. - You can ask Almost Headless Nick, he invited us there.   - Of course I'm going to ask," the tall-haired man hummed.   - Severus!" the Iron Lady exclaimed. - You're not an Auror, and they're not interrogated!   - Of course," the bastard nodded, but everyone could see that he would dig his nose into the ground just to attribute Trio to the incident. Argus was still sobbing beside the cat.   - I could have broken that spell! - Lokahrt suddenly cut in. - I have already encountered such a thing in the steppes of the Kherson region. Where, under the scorching sun, three trolls wanted to cook shish kebab from our group and...   - Pomona, dear," the headmaster completely ignored the scribbler's remarks. - You seem to have ripe mandrakes, don't you?   - Yes, of course," the plump, good-natured woman cheered. - In six months, maybe a little more, you can make an infusion out of them.   - You see, Argus," the Headmaster smiled. - Your cat will be fine. In the meantime, please make sure that tomorrow morning, the students don't have to flinch when they see that sign.   The janitor muttered something inaudibly in response. Apparently it was such an agreement. By all appearances, the situation had cooled down and soon everyone would have dispersed, but the Iron Lady suddenly glanced at Weasel, who had already taken about five steps back and was about to duck into an alcove and get away from trouble.    - And you, Ilya, were also at the Jubilee? - the cat asked. Everyone turned to Ilya, as if they had just remembered that he was standing here too.   - No.   - So why did you leave before the celebration was over? I don't remember you refusing to eat yet.   - Honestly?    - Of course," the Dean of Scarlet was indignant.   - You asked for it," the boy shrugged. - I wanted to take a shit so badly, I was going for a ride on the first spacewalk to the sartre.   - Mr. Ilya!" the professors exclaimed together.   - Minus twenty points to Slytherin for being rude! - McGonagall added.   Weasel sighed heavily again. Another year of trouble was assured for him...   - And I still want to shit.   - Mr. Ilya!         November 6, 1992, Hogwarts, Quidditch pitch.                Ilya felt nauseous, his hands trembling, clutching the parchment sheet he had taken with him for some reason. Ever since this morning, Ilya had not been able to think soberly, he could not even eat. Weasel refusing to eat was something out of the ordinary. Ilya ran his eyes over the parchment leaf once more:      "Match 1: Gryffindor - Slytherin   November 6.       Match 2: Puffendum vs. Ravenclaw   November 27.       Match 3: Ravenclaw - Slytherin   February 7.       Match 4: Gryffindor vs.   March 14.       Match 5: Puffendum vs. Slytherin   May 6       Match 6: Gryffindor vs.   May 28."      It wasn't hard to guess that this was the schedule for the matches. The Hog Quidditch Cup was played on a round robin system, where everyone battled everyone else. The winner was determined by the number of points earned during the season. If it ended up being a tie between the two faculties, it was a head-to-head match. And so today, the first match was to take place. For most, the most meaningful match of the year. But while most in the castle craved spectacle, Ilya wished to invent a time machine, to go back a couple of months and kick himself in the head and convince him not to join the team.   He had never felt such excitement before in his life. And the atmosphere in the locker room, where the young Hunter of the Slytherin team was now sitting, was not at all reassuring. Ilya looked around and realized that he was the only one with trembling knees. Even bloody Malfoy was as calm as a boa constrictor who had just eaten five monkeys.   - Tonight is our first game of the season," Flint stood with his hands behind his back like a general in front of an army. - We've been practicing hard for two months and I'm sure we'll be able to play well. Our goal tonight is to beat the Vultures. They have got a decent catcher, but our strength is that we don't just have one player who can make a match. I expect full commitment from all of you. Now, let's go kick some cat ass!   - Yes!" six men yelled at the top of their lungs.   He was in the middle of a long walk to the stadium, and Ilya was in the middle of a walk to the stadium. Walking down this gut, Ilya felt like a gladiator in ancient Rome about to step onto the blood-stained sand of the Colosseum. Ilya frantically sucked in the air with dilated nostrils, but his heart still could not calm down, it was beating furiously, furiously. Leaving no chance for calm. His back was soaking wet, as if someone had hosed the boy down.    And then, the flaps rise, and Ilya squints for a moment at the bright, midday sun, and is drowned out by the screams of half a thousand people. The bleachers shimmer by sector with the colors of the faculties. Here, too, are the red and gold banners of Gryffindor, whose supporters trumpet and spell out wishes to their own and blasphemies to others. And the yellow and black colors of Hufflepuff, who support the Lions today. Nor should we forget the bronze-blue scarves and Ravenclaw turnovers that cheered for a beautiful game, openly not supporting anyone, but still giving sympathy to the scarlet ones. And, of course, the green-and-silver Slytherin lake, which could just about burst into flames from the buzzing emotion in the sector.   From some stupor, not unlike that of a typical bosot, the lad was roused by the high, lingering whistle of Madame Hook. She was standing on the ground, and at her feet was a heavy trunk containing four balls. Two bludgers that literally broke the chains in which they were entangled, a snitch that lay on a golden stand as if made for golf, and a brown, leathery, quaffle. At one glance at this ball, Ilya almost said goodbye to what was still in his stomach with excitement.    - Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen! - Leigh Jordan had already grabbed the microphone and was speaking in the voice of a dashing, upbeat, upbeat announcer. - I'd like to welcome you to the first match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin! What? Can't hear you! Let's have a little shout-out for our players!   Ilya broke into another fit of cold sweat as the field drowned in the raucous clamor.   - On the field today, from Gryffindor is the everlasting Captain and Goalkeeper - Oliver Wood! Three of the most adorable Huntresses in Castle history - Alicia Spinet, Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell! With bats in hand tonight are the people with one brain for two - the Weasley Twins! And the pride of the faculty, the youngest catcher in the last hundred years, the man who catches the Snitch with everything he can catch, the Catcher - Gaaaaaaaaaaaaari Potter!   The stands literally exploded. Weasel was astonished, the usually shy Hair Pineapple, looked perfectly calm as Ilya looked for a way to fall underground.   - And now, the Slytherin team! If you'll notice, they're all holding their brand new Nimbus 2001 brooms. Accelerating from zero to sixty in a second and two, turning flat in zero and four, turning on...   - Mr. Jordan, comment on the match.   - Oh, yeah, sorry, Professor. Now, we all know how these brooms relate to the new catcher on the team...   - Jordan!   - That's it. And don't take the mic away from me. So, in the gate, the man who can catch a quaffle with a broomstick is Miles Bletchley! As chasers, we are fortunate to have Pregrin Derreck and Lucian Boul! Hopefully, the boys will slow down today, or our Twins will do it later! Also on the pitch, our big man, captain of the Slytherin team, Hunter - Marcus Flint, and with him comes Graham Montague, a man who can miss even from the five metre line. As the Catcher is Draco Malfoy, who seems to care more about his hair than his game!   - Joe...   - I got it, I got it! Gentlemen, you already figured out that I forgot someone, right?! That's right. Today marks the debut of the first ever Normal Slytherin. Please welcome Slytherin's new Hunter, our musician and our own guy - Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeberth Ilya!   Ilya tried to disassociate himself from his surroundings, but he wasn't very good at it, his heart was beating so fast that it was about to jump out of his chest. He climbed onto the broom, grabbed the shaft with trembling, sweaty palms, and soared upward along with a dozen other players. Madam Trick lifted the ball in one hand, the other putting the whistle to her lips.    - The referee blows his whistle and the ball is in play! Flint immediately intercepts it and rockets towards the Gryffindor rings! See how he dodges Fred's bludger, as if the broom carries him lower. Cap is blocked by Spinet and Bel. What's he gonna do? Yes! He passes to Illya, who stays in midfield - very clever! This could be another home run!    Ilya couldn't even breathe, let alone move his arm or move a millimeter to the side. The world was spinning around him, sometimes frozen, as if some madman had spun him a broken whirlwind. In one of those frizzes, the kid noticed a brown blob flying toward him at breakneck speed, followed by three red blobs. On reflexes and instinct alone, the boy stretched out his hand and there was a quofl in the catching glove. The world froze, everything around it froze, and the boy sprang from his seat.   - Ilya literally merges his body with the broom and rushes to his opponent's rings! Against him comes Johnson. They go at each other! Everyone knows that Johnson never turns around! It's gonna be a pass!    Herbert saw only rings, he did not notice anything more, only sixty meters and he will be at the target. The main thing was to throw, the main thing was to fly. Weasel swung his body to the left, to the right, and then sharply to the left.   - They will collide! Mordred and Morgana! Illya simply rolls over and slips under Johnson! Obeagain at his best! The way to the rings is open. Wood and Weasel remain one on one!   Ilya flew, seeing the sky instead of the earth, and the ground instead of the sky, but it didn't bother him. There, ahead of him, was the target, and in front of it was another scarlet blur. A blur ready to swallow up the brown blot. But that could not be allowed to happen, it was necessary to outwit the blur and throw the blur into the ring. Ilya had to do it, and nothing else mattered.   - Merlin! What's that boy doing! He's going vertical and spinning like crazy! Is that going to be Terrence's throw?! Yes! Ilya on his way out of the spinning circle, throws an arm out from behind him. Wood rushes to the bottom left! But no! The ball goes straight down the middle, right side! It's a point! And the season opens with a crazy Slytherin goal by Ilya Ilya! Tell me, why isn't that little bastard in our department?!   - Jor...   Ilya's world came back to normal. He hovered, somewhere in the air, and watched the ball slowly float out from behind the rings into the hands of a frustrated Wood. Watched the goalkeeper try on, choosing which of his huntresses to pass to. Watched Malfoy and Potter hover overhead, searching for the golden flyer. He watched as the Hunters dueled, trying to knock each other down with their bludgers, though they soon decided to torture the Hunters as well. Also, Ilya heard this:   - GER-BERT! GER-BERT! GER-BERT! - chanted the stadium.   The boy's heart beat even faster, but he was no longer nauseous, his hands didn't tremble, his palms dried as if in heat, his back straightened by itself. Ilya's crowning, pirate-like smile crept onto his face. He, on a hunch, spread his arms out to his sides and began waving them, as if to hurry the stands. Everything was drowned in the hubbub and shouting, in the chanting of the handsome boy's name. At that moment, the boy drowned in the energy that the crowd threw onto the field. In that moment, Ilya realized that he would never be able to forget that moment again and he could no longer do without the buzzing crowd shouting his name. Ilya realized that even though it would be many years later, one day he would climb onto the stage and the crowd of thousands would be screaming:   - GER-BERT! GER-BERT! GER-BERT!   The boy dived down.         November 12, Hogwarts, Great Hall.       Ilya unfolded the letter, which bore the coat of arms of the Quidditch Association. It showed a broom crossed with a bat, embraced by the enlarged wings of a Snitch.   "Dear Mr. Ilya.    The experts reviewed the tape of your goal. The commission, after a long argument, reached a verdict. Ilya, in his jump, did not violate a single rule established by the Association. He did not throw the quaffle and he did not cross the mark on his broom. Which are the main criteria for a foul. We can't give you back your match win, but we will consider your foul legal. It will henceforth be referred to as "Illya's Feint." And as compensation, we are sending you the following...       Good luck on the field.   Alas Fugas, Chairman of the International Quidditch Association   P.S. the package may be delayed"       Ilya still couldn't come to his senses, as suddenly wings clapped in the air and several parrots. They were holding in their paws a long roll of brown paper.   - Look, Ilya's first package," Malfoy laughed, cheered on by his classmates. - I'm sure he's going to burst into tears of joy. I'm sure he's going to burst into tears of happiness.   Weasel ignored the lunge and still not believing what was happening, tore up the paper. At first he thought he'd been sent an elongated tongue of flame. But then he realized that it was unbearably bright, mahogany. But more importantly, it was a broom. It had "Dror" written on it in Latin, in real gold.    - Gryphon," exhaled Flint as he passed. - Ilya, where did you get that from?   - The association sent it," the boy whispered.   - Association? - didn't believe the team captain and suddenly snatched up the guy's letter. He read it for about five minutes while Weasel himself pulled a Quidditch news magazine from his bag. There, at the very end, was a list of broomsticks and their prototypes attached. For the past few months, everyone had been literally screaming about the Lightning, a German development whose claimed performance was simply impossible.   - You've discovered a new trick," exhaled Marcus, who had suddenly turned from a calm guy into an excited boy. - C... c... cunt, f... f... cake. My Hunter has discovered a new trick!    Everyone at the Slytherin table cringed, no one had ever heard the headmaster swear so openly. He was suddenly turning to the Gryff table, looking up at Wood, and yelling at the top of his enormous lungs.   - Oliver, you bastard! You've got Britain's Hero on your team, and I've got the opener with the exclusive Dror! Suck it, you scrawny vulture!   What began in the hall and how many points each of the faculties lost is beyond description. But after a couple of minutes, the letter was already walking on the hands of the crowd, which had formed around a bewildered Ilya. The broom was feared to be touched, as if it were a living flame. The boy, on the other hand, was reading the magazine. "Dror" was an Israeli development, an exclusive broom, manufactured only to order. The estimated value was seven hundred and twenty-six galleons. The Dror was inferior to the Lightning in speed, inferior in both acceleration and braking, inferior in almost everything but one. The Dror's maneuverability was such that the boy thought the broom could turn a hundred and eighty on a single wish. But what caught the boy's eye was the translation of the exclusive broom's name.   "Dror - has several translations. The most common is a sparrow. It also means "will", "free", "freedom", "swallow".   "I have a broom," the boy thought, running his hand along the shaft. - "My Swallow."          November 21, 1992 Hogwarts       After the Association sent its letter, Ilya's life became more peaceful. You might say it was thanks to Marcus. Flint, standing in the middle of the living room that evening, announced at the top of his voice that if any of the little ones wanted to "deal" with Ilya, the seniors would not interfere. Everyone remembered that the last time Weasel had only been stopped when those very senior students intervened. So now, the guy felt a real zone of exclusion. He just wasn't noticed by the entire faculty, and Ilya was pleased. He was not going to be noticed by the rest of the faculty, and Ilya was pleased. Greengrass kept her mouth shut at Potions, Malfoy only occasionally glanced fierce, Nott played with his jaw at times, and Zabini showed her displeasure as well, but no one was getting involved.    And it would have been all right, and life would have been a natural pie if it hadn't been for that fucking Secret Team. According to Beans, from whom Danger had managed to find out all about the room, the Chamber of Secrets was a farewell gift from Slytherin. There's a terrible villain who likes to bash the heads off everyone who displeases His Serpentine Majesty. It's all a mess. And okay, all this would have remained in words and the cat and the inscription would have been someone's lame joke, but literally after the Gryffindor-Slytherin match, Colin Creevy was taken to the bone surgeons. The diagnosis was stupor. The photographer, wandering around the castle somewhere and taking pictures of everything, managed to run into either a joker or a mythical monster. Hog's temperature had risen.    After this incident, there were whispers and rumors in the corners and nooks and crannies. People discussed who this heir of Slytherin is and what kind of creature lives somewhere in the bowels of the castle. The exhortations of teachers on a theme - the school was searched many times, there is nothing down there except bases and bones of slaves, did not work. People were inclined to the version that the Chupocabra didn't live there and the Heir was some cord from Slytherin. Once they were certain of that, it became dangerous for the Greens to go out alone. Now there were always a few elders beside the younger ones, and the elders themselves moved exclusively in groups. Ilya, with this matter, had no problem. No one could even hold a grudge against him - a dirty girl, after all. So everything was a gun for now. Except, at the moment, the handsome boy was suffering from a serious question.   Ilya stood near the castle news board - on the second floor - and looked at the announcement. Locon and Snape were opening a Dueling Club to teach students the basics of self-defense. It was only open to first, second and third year students. The fourth and above were supposed to know how to pick their noses with a wand.    - Ilya, why don't you sign up? - Brown asked, putting her initials and signature on the form.   - Pondering," the boy muttered, continuing to rub the tails of his bandana.   - You seem strange today," Isabelle said thoughtfully, following Lavender's example and leaving her signature on the sheet. - I didn't think you'd pass up an opportunity to have a legitimate fight with a Slytherin.   - I don't mind the Gryffindors, either," the boy grinned. - And the Hufflepuffs and the Ravenclaws.    - Bloodthirsty," Lavender chuckled. - Okay, we need to find Parvati. But you should sign up, okay? It would be boring without you.   The girls giggled once more and went off somewhere in the direction of the library. People kept coming up, putting their signatures and walking away, and Ilya continued to stand there, indecisively tugging at the blindfold. The choice was very hard, but in the end, the boy decided to do the right thing. He turned away and went about his business. His signature never appeared on the form.   Ilya made his way up to the den floor, exchanging a few meaningless phrases with some upperclassmen and upperclasswomen on the way. From them he learned that a chair had begun to wobble under Dumbledore, as Malfoy Senior was muddying the waters at the Board of Trustees. A frantic hunch struck the boy for a moment, but he immediately brushed it off. Late last year, on the train, he had decided that he would no longer pry into any secrets or investigations. It was neither his business nor his problem.   The den welcomed the boy with its cozy, soft light, the crackling of the fireplace, and the rustling of the ropes, which trembled in a second draught. The first thing the lad did was to remove his tattered bag, which he had laden with various bling, like the amulets of the Indians. Strings of wood, small stones, figures, and so on were strung together. As you can guess, all these were indeed amulets. Occasionally, for practice, the boy drew junior runes, which replaced the simplest and weakest of charms. It was a pity to throw them away, a pity to leave them "in the table" and a pity about the time they'd been wasted. So the boy hung them on his bag.    Ilya took his "tracksuit" out of the bag. The weasel had a pair of shorts, a T-shirt, and sneakers to replace it. During the three months of training, these clothes had already been subjected to household charms, and now they had no effect on it any more. They had to be repaired by hand. So it was no wonder that there were colored seams on a T-shirt and patches on shorts. And the sneakers were firmly covered with glue and duct tape.    After changing his clothes, the boy began to warm up. The first thing he did was squatting, then stretching everything that could and should be stretched, after that he did a breathing workout, and finally he did four laps around the perimeter of the den.   After the warm-up, according to tradition, followed a training session in the ring. Jumping over the ropes, the boy began to beat the "bag". In the absence of such, the boy was simply beating the ring. In the first months, last year, the kid frequently broke his fingers and hurt his wrist a couple of times. There was no one to give him a punch, so Ilya learned from his own wounds, until he realized how to make a fist, where to tense his arm, how to work the body, shoulder and legs.    Ten minutes of padding was followed by footwork. No, not any nice reversing kicks or anything like that, but the usual swings to warm up the ligaments and get the blood flowing. With this in the ring was finished and Ilya staggered to the Swedish wall. There he passed an hour, with pauses for five-seven minutes, doing pull-ups in various grip techniques. Finally, having put his feet on the railings, he began to lift his torso, straining his abs. After his lessons with Flitwick, the boy realized that abs in a duel was the second most important thing, after the wand. If you have a stomach, immobile, flaccid abdominal muscles, there was an 85% chance that even a squib would beat you. That was the end of today's workout. Iron will be tomorrow - after Quidditch practice, but today was an "easy day".    After the workout, the kid had to wash himself in a makeshift bathtub. In the den it was replaced by a fifty-liter tin tub, and a twenty-liter tank, which was connected by a hose. It took Weasel three days to construct this rudimentary structure, most of which he tried to sneak into the hothouse hiding place where he could get it all. Of course, he could 'order' copies from the headquarters, but the headquarters tended to malfunction, and sometimes the copies disappeared. That is why the boy never left anything of his personal belongings here, otherwise he could come back and not see them.   After getting dressed, the boy sat down at the table and opened a work on Numerology. Today he had to calculate the vector programming, adding to it the account of the change of space and the force school of the object. In simple terms, a possible spell had to set the penetrability of elemental protective charms. The task itself wasn't very difficult, but Ilya had been working on it for about two weeks. Because, let's be honest, the kid's power reserves were so small that the usual ways and calculations were not suitable for him. So Ilya had to invent something of his own and look for other ways to solve the problem. Perhaps that's why, in a year and a half, Ilya reached only the eighth chapter in Numerology and the eleventh chapter in Runes. And there were about thirty of them in each work. You may be surprised that a thirteen-year-old student can handle such a field of knowledge at all. But, I assure you, these books were written for those whose knowledge of mathematics is limited to "2+2" and that - at best. So Ilya had a good head start. Until the evening Ilya pored over a magic calculating machine and a parchment sheet, on which the self-writing pen ran tirelessly.    When the night guests were already shining outside the window, the boy closed the book, put the typewriter away, rolled up the scroll, and armed himself with a wand and began to wave it over his left hand. Today was the end of the rituals of turning hands into paws. Weasel, turning his hand into a black paw with a white pad, looked at the schedule of rituals. He was ungodly behind. Judging by the way the average mage should be magicking, in eight months, he should have gotten to his feet by now. But the boy was not discouraged, he originally knew that he would master the science of transformation into an animal, only by the end of the third year. However, he didn't care much about that, there was no hurry anyway.    Ilya got up and headed for the exit, stretching himself sweetly. He glanced around his den as if bidding it farewell, and then out into the corridor. Magic torches were already blazing on the walls, and frosty air crackled across the stones, hiding from the heat. It was still two hours before lights out, and Weasel headed down to the floor below, where tea with Flitwick awaited him. They had no classes today and could just sit in a cozy chair, enjoying the official biscuits and cakes.    The Slytherin turned toward the stairs, and immediately cringed at the pungent, nasty smell. There was a ghost somewhere nearby. And so it was, Almost Headless Nick swam briskly into the next wall. Ghosts, as always, avoided the kid, and he carefully avoided them. Turning a corner, Ilya ducked behind a tapestry depicting a knight battling some fanged monster. He wasn't even going to need Lumos to get down the secret spiral staircase that led to the sixth floor, where the teachers' offices were concentrated.   As he walked up the steps carved in the stone, Ilya thought again that it would be a good idea to make a map of Hogwarts and mark there all the important points, places, secret staircases and passages. That would be a good way to get some gold. After all, a normal Hogwarts map could be had for as much as three shekels. For one of these, and even in the underground trade, would be five kanats. A hundred people would buy one, and that would be a nice profit. However, after some time, weasel realized that the industrial scale, will not pay off the time spent. But he didn't need it for personal use - the Slytherin navigated the castle quite well enough as it was.    Ilya stopped at the door of the charms master's office. For a moment he felt someone's presence. Not a human presence. With the speed of a falling star, the boy drew his wand and turned sharply around. The corridor answered him with a mute rebuke and the measured flicker of torches. Weasel shook his head - over-excited.    Upon entering the office, the sophomore found the professor at his favorite pastime. Flitwick was poring over another parchment, chewing on a quill.   - Come in, Ilya," said the professor without taking his head off. - Don't embarrass me by the fact that you are growing and I am not.   - Good evening, Professor," the boy smiled and sat down in the chair opposite.   There was already a puffing kettle, mugs, and two vases on the table. One - with biscuits, the other - with cakes. Ilya quickly poured himself a fragrant, hot drink and briskly munched on the treat.   - Not the kindest evening I've ever seen," the dwarf shook his head. Removing the parchment, he performed the same manipulation as the Slytherin. - This Chamber of Secrets is a real headache.   - Mofeh hfo-fo-fo-fo?    - If only, Ilya, if only. I don't think we have a Black Magic genius at our school capable of casting such a detrimental curse.   - What if he's in code? - snickered the boy.   - Oh, then he's far surpassed you in his stealth," the professor squinted predatorily.   - I feel cheated," the boy sobbed feignedly, popping a liver into his mouth. - Turns out there's someone more sneaky than me.   - Weaseliness and meanness, Ilya, are different things. And what's happening now is no joke, and laughing about it is very dangerous. And as far as I know, you haven't even signed up for the dueling club. May I ask why?   The boy hesitated and squelched his tea loudly.   - Well, um, I've been thinking. Anyway, it's probably not gonna be pretty. I'm, uh, kind of dueling with you guys, and then I'm gonna go to this club and start fucking my peers... ...fuck them up.    - So?   - Well, that's not the honorable thing to do. That gives me the advantage!   Flitwick stared at the boy for a while, then laughed his own cawing laugh. Ilya blushed slightly and ducked into his cup. The master of enchantments, wiping away his tears, decided to speak:   - Ilya, Merlin, you are a child. I'm glad you've decided to learn how to be noble, but, really, don't be offended like an idiot who's ready to smash his own head in at a prayer service. One must know the measure in everything. Tell me Ilya, in a real fight will you also fight - using only what your opponent can handle?   - Of course not!   - There's your answer. Just because you have some kind of advantage does not make you dishonest or ungodly.    - So I can sign up? - the boy got excited.   - I would be most disappointed if you did not," Flitwick nodded.   Ilya looked at the clock hanging on the wall, and realized that he had only an hour to get to the board and leave his autograph there. Ilya was about to choke on his tea when he got up at the same time, adjusting his robe and throwing his bag on. The boy darted toward the door, opening it with a jerk, but Ilya froze on the threshold.   - Thank you, Professor," Weasel uttered the "ritual" phrase.   And got a "ritualistic response."   - You're welcome, Ilya. Absolutely nothing.   The doors closed. The boy sprinted up the first floors to the east wing. His heart was beating fast, and his lips were shining with a pirate's grin.             November 22nd, 1992, Hogwarts Great Hall.           The junior classes were literally on a roll today. Right from the morning the Dueling Club was to be run by Lockhart and Snape. And the second year, was to be the first to undergo a "baptism of fire". Ilya's hands trembled slightly, but not because of excitement, like at a Quidditch match, but because of impatience. After all, Ilya couldn't see himself without flaunting something to show off. And here was such a chance, of course, he couldn't pass it up.    - And yet you came.   Ilya turned and saw a trio of friends - Brown, Parvati, and McDougal. With them three, the boy was most closely associated, but still, the relationship remained warm and friendly, not any kind of friendship. Weasel never managed to make any friends in the castle. It made him sad at times, but Ilya often didn't have a second of free time for such idle pursuits as reflection or the like.    - I couldn't miss it," Ilya shrugged.   - Your behavior last night made us question that," Isabelle smiled, fixing her hair.    - I just couldn't leave you in the company of those boring little brats.   - How noble of you," Parvati rolled her eyes and put her palm to her forehead to show her gratitude. All this was, naturally, in jest.   - That's what I mean," the boy nodded, his chest puffed out in a pompous general's pose. I got the idea from Flint.   The girls laughed. Ilya adjusted the bandana, which had a habit of sliding slightly out of his wavy hair. As he struggled with the bandage, the doors to the Great Hall opened and a flood of students poured in. The general throng carried Ilya, who could barely keep his tails tied as he was elbowed from all sides.   Judging from the ceiling, the weather today was not the most pleasant. The sky had already turned gray, and the sun was hiding, fearing that winter was the hostess. And this very winter was just about to come to this land of Foggy Albion, covered everything with snow and covered glasses with fanciful patterns. There were only a few days before the first snow and Ilya, as always in winter, did not feel very well.    The room itself hadn't undergone much of a transformation. The sixth graders had already practiced their apparatus today, so there were no tables. But in the center there was a high platform, like weasel had in his den and what he had seen in Flitwick's hall. Already towering on the platform was Locons, as usual overly perfumed, overly brightly dressed, and smiling too openly. The whole thing evoked one negativity and a note of squeamishness. Weasel didn't understand what this glossy whip could teach him at all. Except how to wipe his own ass while looking like a washed up peacock.    Ilya, led by the crowd, literally pressed himself against the platform, which was at the level of his chest. So he had to raise his head slightly to see what was going on above. Next to the guy was a trio of badgers, led by Justin Fin-Fletchley. The lad hadn't changed a bit since last year, not externally of course, but internally. Jas, as his buddies called him, was still the same good-natured, but short-tempered and timid kid. And he still irritated Ilya. Though with him, Jas, one could sometimes chat about normal things, since the young badger was a muggleborn.    As the hubbub in the hall grew to a crescendo, Lawkons came charging up the platform like a polished copper nightcap.   -"My dears," the scribe began his speech. - With the permission of our esteemed headmaster, I am opening a dueling club in order to teach you to defend yourselves against the most terrible and frightful dangers. I promise to teach you everything I know! My assistant will be Professor Snape, who has kindly accepted the position. Let's give him a warm welcome!   Gilderoy clapped, but he was the only one who dared do so. The potter ascended the platform like a bat climbing the sheer vault of a cave. His robe gleamed in the moonless night, blurring like spilled fuel oil. Batman was back in Gotham... Anyway, the people murmured, and Lockhart didn't even seem to realize what he'd signed up for.   - So, my dears, now Professor and I are going to demonstrate you a basic dueling spell that will help you in almost any situation. The disarming spell. With it I defeated the black Polish wizard, Zarski, who tormented a village near Budapest. Well, Professor, please.   The adult mages turned around on the platform, turning to face each other. Ilya was sure that in a moment Lockhart would be the stuffing for a "Lovett's pie. The mages raised their wands in the manner of swordsmen, placing them parallel to the nose line of their faces.    - On the count of three, Professor," Lockhart continued to smile. - One! Two! Three!   - Expeliarmus! - The potter said calmly.   His wand soared in a black, blurred ribbon that shot out a red, jagged beam. It whizzed by like a bullet, hitting a dazed Gilderoy. The stick flew from the scribbler's hand, and the pompous peacock reeled off a couple of meters backward, slamming visibly on the dais. Ilya whistled - Snape had put quite a lot of force into the spell, since Lockhart was thrown backwards. In a standard case, the Expelliarmus would only rip out the wand. By the way, you'd have to be pretty nimble to put more power into a spell than you'd calculated when you created it. And if Bald-haired could do that with a martial spell, he must be pretty smart. Weasel wondered what the bastard was hiding.    By this time, Lockhart had already risen to his feet, threw his hair back, and stretched his lips in a smile again. In a slightly strained and slightly frightened smile.   - Whew! - exhaled the holder of some awards for sparkling teeth. - Of course I could have deflected that simple lunge! But I decided to show the students the effects of the spell.   Snape grimaced and, with evident disgust, levitated his wand back. Lockhart was so awkward that he didn't catch it right away, and he clearly had to try hard not to drop the weapon on the wooden planking. The Slytherins began to chuckle, overhearing this Snape lightened slightly. Weasel realized that the Bastard liked it, liked feeling stronger than someone, and liked it when others felt the same way. Somehow that kind of behavior didn't tie in with the potionsmith's profession. However, Ilya brushed it off for once, reminding himself that secrets and intrigue were no longer for him. It was none of his business.    - Now we're going to split you into pairs and you're going to try this spell on your opponent.    With these words, a long process of public division followed. Most of the people stood either against their friends, or against those who wanted to get their faces kicked in. For some reason no one stood up against Ilya, it was as if no one noticed him at all. So the boy stood in complete prostration, folded his arms across his chest, watching what was going on around him. And it was chaos all around.    Not a single student even tried the new spell. What's more - they didn't have a chance to do it, because Snape swung his wand so fast that it was impossible to distinguish anything. No, Harry the bloody catcher-Potter, though, was trying to mimic that swing on his friend Ronald, who was standing at attention and staring tensely somewhere in the distance. Ilya looked around. There were flashes of "funny" curses and simple spells flashing around, but Red and Shaggy represented an island of calm in an ocean of madness. Illya brushed off the mystery for as long as he could, but then he saw Milicent naturally fighting Granger. And before, Ilya had been pretty sighted, but after Animagia, he began to acquire some of the qualities inherent in his animal. He had no trouble seeing the Gryffindor's hand twitch for a moment, taking something off the Slytherin's robe, slipping it into her pocket, and then trying to unhook the fat, ugly girl from herself. Here, even a fool would have known - the Trio was up to something again. But Weasel still intended to stay out of it.   Soon there was a veritable thunderous burst through the hall, making everyone freeze in place. Snape was standing on the platform, still frowning, holding his black wand, pointing it at the ceiling. Apparently, he was the one who created that rumble, which drew attention far better than Lockhart's running and wailing.    - Thank you, Professor," Gilderoy rose to the platform, breathing heavily. Snape only nodded softly and continued to glare at everyone at once. And how does he do that? - Perhaps it was a little premature to break you into pairs in the hall. So now, the professor and I will summon the students and they will ascend the platform to demonstrate their skills to us. Severus, who will you challenge?   The potter jerked when Lokahrt said his name. For a moment he thought he was going to smack the scribbler, but no, the master over the cauldrons held back his urge. For a while, the Dean of Green glanced around the hall, everyone hiding their peepers - except Potter, who responded with a challenge. Suddenly the black beads that were replacing Bastard's eyes collided with Weasel's blue saucers. Ilya knew at once, and was already moving toward the stairs, making his way through the crowd.   - Ilya Ilya and Nott Theodore," the dean of the green squeaked.   Whispers were heard in the hall. Weasel was walking quietly up the stairs, from the scribbler's side, who was looking at him with surprise. At Snape's side, a visibly cheerful Nott was coming up. He'd been dreaming of getting back at Illya since last year. Poppy had said then that Theo would never be able to use his right arm properly, but Nott's family had hired the best healers, giving them a considerable amount of gold, and they had restored the boy's working arm. But it was Ilya's understanding that a meeting with the visage's ancestors would end in the orphan's death. Not only were the Nottes prominent aristos, but they were also former Eaters who had somehow gotten out of prison. In general, Snape in quite the repertoire - decided to humiliate the Weasel, because he reasonably believed that the ancestors had trained their child and set him on the right path, at the end of which the guts of a filthy girl glittered with the finish ribbon.    - Young man, I don't remember you taking my class," he said to the whole room. Proclaimed Lockhart, whose voice reflected his insult.   - Because I don't go to them," shrugged the bogeyman.   The scribbler puffed up with indignation, and tried to find the words to express it. At the same time, Snape was flashing his eyes predatorily, and Nott was grinning miserably as he wiggled his wand. It was as if he was showing he could do Illya in - just give him the go-ahead. Ilya was calm. Just as he always was when he faced his opponent on the asphalt paths of Skary Square. It was simple. Hit right away, hit first, hit so that he didn't get up, and if he got up, finish him off.    - Professor, maybe we should call someone else. If the boy didn't go to class, he could be seriously hurt.   - That will be his problem," Zellevar replied firmly. -On the count of three, disarm each other!   - One!   Nott threw up his wand, getting into a fencing stance. He pushed his left leg back and glared into the center of Ilya's mass. That's right - his parents were showing him something at home. In a duel, it was the same as in a gunfight - hit in the center of mass, it was sure to knock him down, damage his vital organs, and almost kill him.    Ilya, tucking back his robe on his right side, didn't even think about pulling out his wand. He only smiled piratically, holding his hand over his wand. Snape, Nott, and Lockhart (Ilya was probably standing with his back to him) glared contemptuously. How about that - the orphan had no respect for dueling etiquette. But that was the etiquette that Ilya was putting a grub on from the biggest bell in the world.   - Two!   Nott could see that he was pondering which spell to cast on his hated comrade-in-arms. Ilya was still standing there, just stretching his lips in a smile. Like a predatory cat that had cornered a mouse and was now going to play with it a little.   - Three!   - Furu...   No sooner had Theodore finished his curse on pimples and pustules than Ilya's right hand turned into a smudge. A red spark seemed to fly out from behind his belt, then turned into a ball of fire, glittering in the flickering palm of the boy's hand.   - Incendio! - pronounced Weasel.   A ribbon of fire shot out of the orb, spiraling into a spiral and hurtling toward Nott. He was about to finish his spell when a flaming whip suddenly wrapped itself around Theodore's brown wand. Ilya twitched his arm intricately, bending it at the elbow. There was a loud crack. Chips and splinters spilled onto the floor. Nott was holding only the hilt. The wand was sliced in five pieces.    The Dogs' son was dumbfounded. He stared at what was left of his faithful friend in amazement and couldn't fathom the reality. Snape was clearly angry and glared angrily at the smirking Ilya. He had no intention of letting go of the spell, and was playing with it like a marshal's whip.    - Why?" The musician shrugged. - They told me to disarm, I disarmed.    Ilya, sensing the heat of the situation, released the spell. Lockhart was silent, apparently afraid to open his mouth.    - Mr. Nott, send a letter to your parents," the bastard hissed. - I'll open a passage for you in the fireplace this evening - go with them and buy yourself a new wand.   - But...   - I said write a letter.    Theo looked down at Weasel, silently promising him all the torment of the abyss, and walked down the bridge, disappearing into the crowd. Ilya, on the spur of the moment, with a theatrical gesture took off his non-existent hat and bowed on four sides. There was laughter and clapping.   - Come on down, Mr. Ilya," the snotty-haired man continued to hiss.   Ilya decided not to pull his luck by the tail and other organs and so jumped off the platform. He was immediately surrounded by some vultures, crows and badgers. They clapped him on the shoulders and congratulated him on his confident victory over the "punk slug".   - I told you," Lavender whispered. - It'll be more fun with you.   - So no one was arguing," Ilya winked.    They weren't allowed to finish as Snape hissed again, and once again it silenced everyone present. There were still waves of excitement and discussion about the recent events, but most were still focused on the platform. The half-haired man was already back to his grimness and equanimity, but Lockhart was clearly in need of some valerian. He was so worried that he didn't even notice that his hands were shaking slightly and his palms were glistening with droplets of sweat.    - Since you summoned the first pair, I should summon the second," Lockhart muttered. He looked around quickly, and then excepted a glow of happiness. - Harry Potter and... Ronald Weasley.    - Let me," Snape interjected again. - Wooheeley's wand is out of order, and unless you want to scrape Potter off the floor later, you shouldn't summon him.   - And who are you suggesting?   - Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.   - "Bond, James Bond," Weasel hummed to himself.   To the whispers, shouts of encouragement, even laughter, the two arch-enemies entered the local arena. Potter was a little confused, disheveled, unkempt, and unkempt, looking like he always did. Malfoy was glowing with anticipation, just like Nott a few minutes ago.    - On the count of three, try to disarm each other," Lockhart hissed in a broken voice. - Only disarm! One!   Malfoy raised his wand. Potter repeated the gesture. The shaggy-haired one sort of swayed, and went into his fighting state, where the devil himself and the sea is knee-deep in him. He was a natural Gryffindor.    - Two!    - Tarantalegra! &shy;" Draco shouted out a spell that made people do a frantic dance.   Blondie started off with a false start, but Lockhart was so freaked out that he went for a walk in the astral, and Snape was up to the fan as to who, when, and what was taking a shot at the hated bespectacled man.    A yellow beam slipped from the Slytherin's wand, and disappeared into Potter's shielded spell. Malfoy's protego glowed with a silver cloth, much brighter and denser than anyone from first or perhaps even fourth year. Malfoy was as surprised as Snape, though the latter didn't show it. And Potter wasted no time, he drew a pattern in the air rather quickly and shouted:   - Expulsio!   There was a chuckling sound, and the spell that usually knocked over textbooks and pillows slammed into Malfoy. Except with Potter, you could crumple a sheet of lead with that spell, so it was no surprise that Draco flew up into the air as a broken doll, tumbled through the air and landed on his ass for the second time this year - with an audible pop.    Laughter erupted in the hall, and Ilya laughed out loud. Severus, lifting his godson to his feet, whispered something in his ear. Malfoy nodded and turned abruptly. Blondie drew some flowing lines in the air and shouted loudly:   - Serpensortia!   The wand emitted a green flash, and a lump of some kind flew out from the tip. It plopped down on the platform and soon turned into a real cobra. It spread its hood and hissed dangerously. Everyone took a step back in a jiffy, and a startled gasp echoed through the hall. Summoning an animal isn't like shoving a wand up a troll's nose. That kind of summoning didn't go by the fourth year. Either that, or his forefathers didn't teach him very well, or he wasn't very bright. The snake did not attack Potter, but turned to Justin Fin-Fletchley, who was standing literally a few feet away from Ilya. He was not frightened of the snake himself; it hissed, but if he threw it, someone would have a wallet made of snakeskin.    Fin-Fletchley, on the other hand, went pale, clenched into a lump, ready to shed a tear. Cobra rattled a rattle, opened her hood even more, and flicked her bifurcated tongue. Lockhart already seemed to be pissing his pants but Snape was inactive as he was a little busy staring at Potter. Pronra turned to the bespectacled boy and was dumbfounded. The usually hesitant kid, suddenly straightened his shoulders, lifted his chin and took a step forward that exuded power and an urge to command.    - Sasss-hiias-s-s," Potter hissed.   And it wasn't a hiss from Snape or Danger, it was a real, snaky hiss that somehow came from a human mouth. Cobra folded her hood and turned to face the bespectacled man. He had already assumed his usually bewildered look.   - Sasss-hiias-s-s," he repeated, but somehow modestly.    Cobra seemed to resist something and turned to Jas again.   - Ignium! - Zel'evar's voice boomed.   A flash stabbed my eyes, and with a loud hiss the cobra vanished in sparks of bright flame, extinguished only after consuming the last bit of flesh. Silence hung over the hall. Lockhart was still in astral, Snape looked stunned, the hall reeked with fear.    - Potter snickered," Ilya heard Lavender whisper in a startled voice.   - So what? - Ilya shrugged, not realizing yet that the black ass of trouble was rapidly falling on his head.            December 2, 1992, Hogwarts.               After that memorable incident ten days ago, things got hot in the castle. For starters, the dueling club had been closed, declared unsafe. How Lockhart hadn't been fired in the process was probably unknown, even to the headmaster himself. The trouble was that they weren't allowed to sit in the library, the study room, the classroom, or the corridor, without hearing the story of how Potter had killed the Dark Lord, so that he could go and do his own evil deeds. Why? Because it's obvious to a fool that if he's a snake-eater, he's a badass and a radish.   Everyone was looking at Potter, who was walking around grimly and resentful of the world. The Twins added fuel to the fire. They, at times, ran around the bespectacled boy and dropped black petals on him, shouting something like - "Make way for His Darkest Majesty Harry Potter. Understandably, the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets began to be blamed on Shaggy.   Fin-Fletchley was the one who got the most razzle-dazzle. He said he'd heard Potter threaten to kill Creevey for taking pictures of him all the time. And that at the Club, Harry wanted to set a snake on a harmless badger because he was a true Muggleborn.    Ilya was amused rather than frightened by all this quibbling. The well-read boy was well aware that the talent of communicating with animals was a popular thing among ancient families. Once upon a time there was even a citizen who could sprech on an elephant, and okay, was a normal guy. So if there are people who quack with ducks, why can't there be those who hiss with snakes. And the fact that Slytherin and Voldemort were talking to them, that's not surprising. Potter, Slytherin, they all come from the Quavers. And there's a hell of a lot of aristocratic blood mixed in. So he's a talented bespectacled boy, and he's doing just fine with that much magical power. He's a dangerous enough person without a snake's tongue, except that he's a drooler and a sissy. In general, weasel just waved off those who wished to wrangle on a popular and fashionable nowadays subject. He had no time for that - Flitwick had brought up the subject again. And now the fighting was like beating Ilya. But he did not complain, only wiping blood and clenching his teeth continued his attempts.    Now the boy was going to the secret passage leading to the dungeons, so that he could get some sleep after a crazy week. The stairs were on the second floor, where the boy hadn't liked to go lately. It was the smell. The very, musty, stale, stinky, horrible smell that usually bloomed in Snape's study and potions class. Except now he'd also made it to the abandoned bathroom where Crybaby-Mirtle lived. The boy wasn't particularly steamed about it, as he didn't want to interfere with yet another mystery.    Before he reached the corner, he suddenly heard.   - We have to ask! - It was Granger, clearly proving something to someone.   - But why? - Here comes the Weasleys. -We've almost got the potion ready-we'll find out for ourselves.   - Then - that we can solve the problem without breaking the rules.    - It was actually your idea.   - Ron," Potter said, and then, well, there was Potter. - Hermione was right, we should ask Ilya.   Ilya didn't remember his namesake living in the castle, so he smiled and came around the corner. It was worth it. The trio immediately fell silent and stared dumbfounded at the handsome Slytherin who was playing with his lighter.    - So?" said Weasel. - What's the fuss about? Why are you going to interrogate me?   The boys stepped back and Granger took the floor.    - Ilya, what do you know about the Heir?   - Mmm, which one? If anything - I don't have any heirs, I haven't had time yet.   The girl blushed slightly and clenched her fists.   - I mean the Slytherin heir.   - Oh, you mean him. He's all right, he's a nice guy. We had crayfish and beer with him last night.   - What?    - Nothing," Ilya sighed wearily. - I don't know your Heir. Is that all? Can I go to bed now?   The trio looked at each other and blocked the way. Weasel tipped his tongue and threw back the hem of his robe. He'd dealt with those three dashingly last year, but this one was going to be tougher. He only had two spells in his arsenal, and the Trio's total power was forty times greater than what the bosota possessed. It's like King Leonidas facing the Persians. But where are those Persians, and where is Leonidas?   - Ilya," Potter interjected. - Do you know if it was Malfoy who opened the Room?    Ilya gasped, then glared rather angrily at the Gryffindors.   - I don't get it. Either you're retards with beaks up your asses, or you're just fools. I told you that Ilya has never snitched on anyone in his life and has no intention of doing so.   - But it's Malfoy!" Weasley exclaimed. - You hate each other!   - And that's our problem," Ilya growled. - Malfoy is a fuckhead, a faggot, a ghoul. But he's in my class, and if he were a devil in the flesh I wouldn't rat on him, much less you. Now, if you don't want to flinch, get out of my way.   The trio looked at each other again and parted ways. As they passed, Ilya gave Potter a tangible shove with his shoulder, and he staggered back against the wall. Weasel went without turning around, he could dodge a spell thrown at his back, but no one was throwing anything. The Slytherin's mood was rapidly sinking to the level of a rotten plinth. Even if he stayed away from mysteries and riddles, they still found him, just like the Golden Children. And why do they have to stick their noses everywhere, you sick assholes.   However, in five minutes Ilya had already forgotten about the incident. The bed and the soft featherbed, which were waiting for him in the bedroom, occupied his thoughts completely.     Chapter 17   December 22, 1992. Hogwarts   The holidays snuck up on us. Or rather - they crept up unnoticed, until they received a powerful kick and literally collapsed on the heads of the students. Another incident occurred last week. This time it was Justin Fin-Fletchley and, amazingly enough, Almost Headless Nick who got hurt. After that, the castle was literally convinced that the true Slytherin Heir was Harry Glasses-Bikes-Potter. The only people who remained on the boy's side were his friends and the Weasley family, with the exception of Percy. But he didn't care about anything at all, except his girlfriend and finding a place to get some privacy.   Ilya himself tried to distance himself from the whole catastrophe, but he was hindered by the three female friends. For some reason they were convinced that the next victim was sure to be Ilya. And now the girls were literally dragging Ilya by force into the Gryffindor living room where, in their opinion, he would be perfectly safe, since Potter would not be wetting himself in front of everyone. At first, Lnes still tried to resist their pressure, but then he simply waved goodbye and let them do whatever they wanted with him. Eventually, he sat at Scarlet's place for days on end, minding his own business and occasionally playing around on Babe.   The chair beneath Dumbledore was wobbling with such force that it was no longer possible to tell when there would be a change of headmaster. And now this was already making the asylum seeker anxious. For, let's not deny, it was only thanks to the silver-bearded dedan that he had not yet been expelled for all the tricks he had managed to pull in a year and a half of study. And if Albus really get kicked out of school, there is a good chance that after him, with a parting ass-kick and Ilya will fly out. He is not going to be able to get rid of his peculiar thorn in his side, even with the patronage of the Master of Arts, since the Headmaster, the Iron Lady, will only be glad to get rid of the peculiar eyesore.   And therein lay the lad's dilemma. The last incident fitted perfectly into the picture that weasel had painted for himself. But the thing was, firstly, that he had promised himself not to get involved in all these investigations (and Ilya always keeps his promises, because there is nothing but words), and secondly, Ilya never forgets debts, neither his nor other people's. So it turned out that he had to wait for a convenient moment when personal principles will not be violated. But the boy could not understand why no one else can add up so simple terms and calculate the root of evil. However, even here Ilya had his own answer.   Adults are too fond of complicating things and therefore cannot see the simplicity of the solution, and the Trio of Detectives are very biased and cannot see beyond their own noses. No, eventually they will figure it out, but by that time Ilya can be expelled. That obtained a stalemate situation in which any step somehow or other will backfire on you. So for the time being Ilya decided to do nothing and continue to go with the flow.   Ilya looked in the mirror. He had stretched too much in six months, and now he was at the same height as the fourth-year students. He looked more like fifteen than thirteen and a half for some reason. Something in the boy seemed to have clicked, so that he was growing at least one and a half times faster than the average person. So far it did not interfere at all, but if Ilya will look at fifteen to eighteen, and at sixteen to almost twenty-one, that's when the problems begin. And if only it could be written off to constant training literally until the loss of consciousness, but the face they should not so much affect. Ilya shook his head and began to put on his dressing gown.   The Weasleys were sending him three galleons every month out of the five the foundation was contributing, and for once, Ilya decided to splurge on a new robe. No, he hadn't intended to splurge at all, it was just that the current gown had fallen apart when the Slytherin decided to repair it. As a result, the young man ordered himself a black, with silver ruffles and buttons, a stylish robe. He had just found an atelier where there was a promotion and so he paid not the full price, but forty percent less, which cost him eight gold and three bronze coins. A crazy amount, considering that if things go on like this, it will obviously become small next year, but then it can be sold to a magic second hand. All in all, Ilya calculated that he would lose about two gold pieces when he resold it, which was exactly the cost of the one-time treat of new clothes to him. Well, after all, it was possible to luxuriate once in a lifetime, even if it cost four hundred pounds.   Ilya gasped. When he converted the cost into normal units, the idea seemed a little crazy to him. I'm not sure how to change it, though - the robe fit him perfectly.    Next he put on his shoes, which had spent two weeks under the restorative runes and now looked a little more presentable. The pants, ironed as always by hand, annoyed the boy somewhat. He would, if he had his way, have ordered denim trousers, but the castle wouldn't understand him, and McGee wouldn't miss an opportunity to mess with him, so he had to walk around in these. And, of course, the white shirt.    He looked in the mirror again, but something still confused him. For a long time Ilya turned around, looking for where there could be a tear, a hole, an uneven or colored seam, until suddenly he froze and slapped himself in the face. Ilya lifted his hand and pulled off his black bandana. Long, black-tousled, wavy hair fell over his face. He worked hard to make something decent-looking out of it, as long as his cheekbones were tousled and pushed down over his cheekbones. He'd have trimmed it down to a regular hedgehog if it hadn't been for the older girls, but pissing off witches was like waving a Chinese or Soviet flag at a bull.   After some more panting, Ilya tucked the bandanna into his pocket (just in case Snape wanted to meet his gaze) and left the bedroom. The entire Slytherin faculty had already gathered in the living room and were waiting for the Headmasters to give the go-ahead so they could head for the Great Hall, where the Christmas feast would be held.   Ilya cautiously pressed himself into a corner, where, folding his arms across his chest and leaning against the wall, he decided to wait for the annual event to begin. But, just in time, right in front of Weasel stood his classmates. These ghouls were always getting bolder before they left for the holidays. Now Greengrass was obviously going to say something, but then she literally "stumbled her gaze" over Ilya's face. She drove her blue eyes over his features, occasionally running over his hair and neck. Daphne seemed to choke on her words. Zabini wanted to rush to her rescue, but she too took the form of a fish. Soon the girls were dragged away by the boys, and Nott managed to glare dangerously, showing that he hadn't forgotten about his wand.   Ilya took the bandana out of his pocket and hummed sadly. It seemed that the days when girls were attracted to this bandage were over. Maybe he should change it for something else. Since the two bitches were pierced by its absence, it was time to rethink the image. Pirate Ilya the weasel, lord of the lake, lord of the squid and the terror of all mermaids, is likely to go next semester on his last voyage, and in the third year someone else will replace him. We just have to figure out who.   Flint and Merinda Ketchback, a stunning brunette with incredible, model-like forms, showed up. The girls' head girl probably manages to change a dozen guys over the summer, since she doesn't date anyone in the castle and even the most desperate gossip girls can't recall seeing her with anyone at all. And sort of, if Weasel's memory hasn't slipped, she is the fiance of Derrek Spin, who graduated last year - clearly from Slytherin. They say their parents, following Aristo tradition, made a prenuptial agreement as soon as Merinda was born. You couldn't even tell if Derrek was lucky or not. On the one hand, Merinda will be obliged to fulfill his marital duty, but on the other hand Derrek will surely have horns, which can reach up to the troposphere. And, of course, Ketchback was the sex symbol of all the seniors and the dream of those teenagers who had just learned what a hormonal surge and body rebuilding was.   - Line up and move out," Flint commanded.   Weasel shook his head. Marcus, whether on the field or in the castle, was always giving orders to the general. How his friends and pals put up with him...   One way or another, the faculty obeyed the command and marched in formation toward the Great Hall. The march passed in silence, only to the rustling of robes, the whispering of portraits and the rattle of clacking heels. In all, the green faculty students "walked" for seven minutes, which is how long it took them to walk from the lounge to the large, tall doors that go under the very vault of the basement floor.    By this time the crows, who always came first, because they had to go out much earlier, because their tower was in another part of the castle, had already arrived. The third came badgers, and late, of course, vultures. Not at all because of bad organization of the process, but because while there all will gather, laugh and find the way - will pass one more semester.   Surprisingly, no squabble arose. The people were already looking forward to the holidays and a quick break from the annoying inhabitants of the ancient castle. Especially from teachers and their endless homework. Those who did not attach importance to it, waited for an opportunity to stuff stomach with delicious food. Our Weasel belonged to this stratum. Today he was going to break his own record for gluttony.   While Ilya was dreamily rolling his eyes and swallowing his drool, he did not notice that the doors of the hall had already opened and the students began to flow in smoothly, seating themselves in their seats. It was quite beautiful in the sky, i.e. the ceiling. As if someone big and strong had dispersed the winter grayness and haze, leaving behind a black summer shroud, thinned with sparkling fireflies and a surreally large moon. Candles floated smoothly and measuredly above their heads, droplets of wax transformed into shooting stars that scattered in colorful fountains as they touched the floor or the fabric of their outer robes. Holidays in Hog have always been colorful and picturesque, and after the summer Ilya began to compare them to the well-known cartoon where a charming, kind, but alas, fictional girl fell in love with a monster. And if the girl can be made up, the monsters are usually quite real, but, alas, no one falls in love with them, so they remain monsters, and not turn into princes charming. Ilya knew it better than anyone else. Because if most people saw him as that same, beautiful prince, then those who looked closely distinguished inside a cold and dead ugly creature, which fearfully huddled in the darkest corner and bearded rows of sharp, sharpened spears. It looked as if it was trying to defend itself against the world, against all humans.   Anyway, enough about that. The headmaster rose from his trump stool. He was no stranger to attire, and on this evening he wore a mauve robe with embroidered spirals of universes, stars, and lunar months. Dumbledore looked like a piece of space that had fallen to Earth and tried to take root here.   The great, but a little crazy, however very good-natured light mage pushed his speech. In it he described everything that cannot be described, wished for things that are usually not wished for, hinted at unity, friendship, brotherhood, eternal love, and lemon wedges, then finally waved his hands. The tables clattered with food.   Ilya sucked in his saliva and pounced on the food, paying no attention to anything else. It was time to stock up on protein and carbohydrates, or who knows when he would be kicked out of school and deprived of the opportunity to feast on freebies. And freebies are sacred, no, sacred.   A few pounds of food later.           Ilya, noisily sucking in air and grunting, left the living room, where only Malfoy remained, still staring blankly into the fireplace. The others had either gone to their bedrooms (the train was early, as early as half past seven) or somewhere, in the case of the older ones, continued the banquet with a noisy or not-so-noisy binge. Draco, on the other hand, was usually quiet and inconspicuous without his faithful friends, like a sheep that had broken away from the flock. And if Nott had gone to see Morpheus, where Kreb and Goyle were, that was a big mystery. However, it was of little concern to Ilya. All he wanted now was to get to his stash on the second floor, where he'd managed to forget the time bomb. You didn't think only Twins did pranks at school, did you?   Ilya sometimes pulled one or another stunt, but it was more out of nothing to do and a desire to get high on adrenaline than out of some highly marginal considerations. He even had his own style - clockwork. You hatch some explosive, smelly, smelly thing, put a clock on it, and take off on all fours. And when it goes off, only fringe people will know whose handiwork this trick is. He was often blamed for the shenanigans of the Twins and their followers (Lee Jordan, for example), but the Slytherin paid no attention to this. He wasn't in it for the recognition, he was in it for the thrill.   But the day before he had left a bombshell in a secret alcove, of which he had forgotten to wind it. It was supposed to go off after supper, when the badgers were on their way back, but, alas, it was a complete failure. Now weasel rushed to the scene of the unfortunate crime. It was unlikely the mages had DNA tests or a database of prints, but they certainly had some magic tricks, and he really didn't want to be identified by them.   There's Vincent and Gregory, by the way. Huge, clumsy, dumb and pretty mean as ever. The colour of the nation, pure-blooded aristocrats. When Ilya was almost on par with Draco's guards, he nearly choked on the disgusting stench of the couple's filthy stench.   The weasel was settling down and clutching his hands to his stomach, trying not to vomit. It looked as if these fools had escaped from Shawshank after crawling a quarter mile down a shit hole where they had soaked themselves in whatever was dripping down the hole.   - Ilya!" came a slightly concerned voice.   The boy heard the stomping of feet, the smell intensified and came closer. He was dizzy, but then it was gone, as if someone had turned off some kind of switch in Ilya's head, or, conversely, turned on a filter. All that remained was a distant, abominable sensation.   The Slytherin got up and saw Crabb and Goyle, only their expressions were different. No, Crabb was still stupid in the face, but he looked spiritual, and was clearly afraid of something. Goyle, on the other hand, looked too smart, wore glasses for some reason, and for some reason called Ilya by his name. There were not so many people in the castle who called Ilya by his full, but friendly name, not by his nickname, or his last name. Rather, only one person called him that.   - Potter," Ilya wheezed, not fully recovered. - I'm going to need you to take off your glasses and make a slightly duller expression.   The doubloons flinched and looked at each other, Potter-Goyle took off his glasses and smiled tautly.   - But you, Ronnie-boy, are the best," the Slytherin grinned. - So it's hard to tell whether you're a dying actor or a dork. So long, Bonds.   He left a couple of detectives behind, who were slightly perplexed, Ilya moved on. He was not the first to think of concocting a conditionally forbidden reversible potion in a school. "Conditionally", because by law it could only be taken by officials of special structures. No wonder Snape had been so suspicious of Ilya the past few months. He must have included him in the circle of suspects who had tampered with his stash. No, he'd have to be a suicidal lunatic or a kamikaze to put a spear on the Half-Hair. It's safer to steal Fawkes from Dumbledore, the headmaster could turn it into a joke. He can't even guess that Shaggy's balls are made of steel, but they are made of a substance that even Mendeleev had never discovered, or maybe he just didn't have time to finish his dream and never saw the last element - Potterianium. How on earth did he manage to persuade a follower of the Iron Lady's rules, Danger, and the dezzled, cowardly Ronald Weasley, to this obviously criminal feat? Maybe he also has a tongue without something in it, but with something in it? Yeah, the bespectacled one is clearly a dangerous and murky individual, the kind that can either be killed or put in a straitjacket and into the darkest zugunder.   The castle, before the holidays, seemed to fall asleep, saying goodbye to the students. The armor faded, the portraits were covered by an invisible film, and even the staircases, the wooden devils who saw the meaning of their existence in Ilya's mischief, became subdued and motionless. It seemed as if Hogwarts, one of the oldest magical fortresses, had long lived for the sake of students, and without them it was an empty and unremarkable place.   As Ilya walked up the now tranquil staircases, he promised himself for the umpteenth time that he would not leave a single magical portrait behind him. This wretched mockery, this pathetic imitation, someone else's bad joke, could not even remind him of the real, full life. It was like a centuries-long imprisonment for grave sins, like a hell, created by people and for people. And Ilya could not understand why there were ghosts. Why did they stay? Why were they afraid to go on? And where could they go further? Was there something there, or was there nothing there? At times these questions plagued Nathan until he had a headache, his nose was bleeding, his eyes were red from lack of sleep. He couldn't understand why others didn't ask them. All right, the purebloods, they were used to it, but the Muggleborns...   The same Jas a couple of years ago, every Sunday he went to church with his family and friends of his parents. Now he lived among ghosts, among inanimate but thinking and even sentient portraits, among what Muggles had long called devilry, but as if he didn't notice it. It gave the impression that the castle was invented by some weak man, for lack of inner core and love for life, lost between this very life and death. A person who could not make up his mind whether to let the dead go, leaving them somewhere, where the Hat is most likely to look, or to keep them near, being able at least to talk. But if the latter, then this man is as selfish as possible.   Ilya, who knew something about the underside of the world that a thirteen-year-old should not know, was sure that life is beautiful just for its own sake, and not its likeness, whatever it may be. Perhaps that's why the portraits bang on the boy with terrible force, and the ghosts bypass him by a tenth of a meter. They sense the boy's attitude, sense his, in fact, rage at the mere sight of the pathetic imitations. At the despicable, translucent cowards who still have the nerve to feel sorry for themselves and try to approach real life, if only with rotten food and stupid fun. And pity for the prisoners of the golden frames, long gone but still existing.   It was all so repulsive, so unnatural, that the boy, at times, in moments like this, literally wished he could escape to the Magic Forest, where everything was so real, so real and alive. Even the lush wind and the green crowns seemed to have far more soul than the painted figures, immortal in their imprisonment.   However, the lad brushed these thoughts aside. Come to think of it, it certainly wasn't life and death that Weasel, leader of the White Feather, head of the defunct organization Power to the Mongooses, and so on and so forth, should be pondering. All Ilya knew of this world was the simple law that Bob Marley had told him in his song - don't worry about minor problems, they will disappear on their own. And, really, death is probably the smallest problem a young wizard from Scary Square can dwell on. The issue of not getting caught with the bomb is a serious sticking point, which can dangerously burn an ass that's already waiting for a not-so-wizardly ass-kicker.   Going up to the second floor, Ilya found the alcove in a jiffy. It was not far from Myrtle's toilet. All one had to do to find it was to stroke the beautiful lady for an object of feminine pride. And this lady certainly could be proud of such items. And don't even ask how Ilya made such a discovery. When all the manipulations were carried out, the lady suddenly giggled languidly and not at all noble and took a step to the side. The tapestry swayed and literally pulled away, exposing a recess in the wall. Here, once upon a time, most likely stood or hung the head of some defeated monster, but when the castle became a school, such recesses were tried to hide. The young man carefully pulled out a Skunk Spray bomb (thanks to the underground Gemini trade), took out the fuse and removed the mechanism, then tucked the three pieces into three different pockets in his bag.   Ilya was about to leave when he heard nasty laughter coming from the abandoned toilet, with which too many events had been connected lately. In between the obvious taunts and pseudo-pitying lulling, there was a girl's sobbing. Literally hysterical - someone was drenched in salty moisture, lashing out in a fit of hysteria. Weasel was momentarily taken aback, he'd never liked women's tears. Probably because his only female friend, Rosie, was too strong to allow herself even a little moist look. Still, it was a good excuse to try on the Gryffindor's role of inflicting good and inflicting justice.   Ilya burst into the bathroom without pulling out his wand. At first he couldn't figure out what was going on here, but then he got a nasty smell from one of the many green stalls. That stench clearly spoke of the presence of an ectoplasmic. Myrtle's sobbing at school was legendary and the hysteria in question didn't even reach the level of a mildly depressed Crybaby. Weasel now felt a fiery rage without a joke. A ghost laughing at a living person was something out of place.   A flicker of fire flashed and the door split in two halves. Ilya managed to notice something black, fluffy, and for some reason in a school uniform, but soon he was fully focused on the shimmering figure of a not-so-pretty girl. Myrtle also noticed the new visitor and swallowed another sneer. There was nothing more disgusting than a humiliated individual who humiliated others. Crybaby Myrtle deserved everything that had happened to her, and would still happen at this school. If she could mock others after first experiencing the same humiliation, then let others mock her a hundred times harder. That's what the raven goblin would say, and the young Slytherin couldn't agree more.   - Why, you vile... - Myrtle hissed in a sudden, belligerent tone.   She even reached for the boy's throat with her palm, but the boy, without even realizing what he was doing, swung his right hand, free of his wand, at the other's stump. Don't forget that Ilya was an ambidextrous and had a good shot with both hands. There was a loud "hiss" as if someone had poured cold water on a hot flame. The ghost shrieked loudly, clutching his hand, and then dived down the drain with a frantic shriek.   - How disgusting," the boy spat. - What kind of a monster is that?   - Go away," came a familiar voice, drowning in tears.   The boy took a closer look. There was a small creature standing in front of him, covered in thick, black hair. It covered its face with half cat and half human paws. It still had those same thickly flattened cat ears, and a long, fluffy tail under its hem. Ilya took a step forward and sucked in air with his nose. Through the distinctly animal, pleasant, woodsy aftertaste, came the stench that came from Creb and Goyle.   - Granger," the boy exhaled, not knowing what to do, trying to console the girl who had set him up so badly in one of his transfiguration classes, or to comfort her. Although, Ilya didn't even know how to console the fair sex. - Not that Potter had gotten you to drink the Backwash either...   - It's me," Catwoman suddenly jumped up.   - I figured I wasn't a loser werewolf.   - No, it was my idea with the Turnover Potion! But I took the wrong hair from Milicent, and it turns out she has a cat!   Ilya hovered a little, as the Slavic priest used to say - sometimes you can find a diver's corpse in a still pool. In this case, the convulsively twitching fetus of a veteran adventurer.   - What, did you put Snape on the spear too?   The girl nodded, her ears twitching slightly, and her sobs subsided. The boy didn't know what he was doing, but the simple conversation was clearly helping. Maybe it was the new knowledge of the opposite field falling into the boy's piggy bank. Suddenly they were calming down from the conversations?   - You're a sight for sore eyes," the boy whistled. - What kind of wreath do you want for your coffin? Natural or artificial?   - Whatever you want," the girl snorted. - And how did you know about the potion?   Ilya snorted now.   - I, unlike you, am not devoid of deductive powers. Well, I also met your friends on the way here. The sight of Goylef with her glasses and some glint of intelligence in her eyes almost sent me to the upper layers of the astral," the boy suddenly smiled slyly and winked at the girl, who pulled her paws away from her face, displaying some sort of mimicry of a human face and a cat's face. - Well, I'm also still the best student.   - You don't go to ZoT!   - Flitwick brings me the tests," the slightly boastful boy cocked his chin.   Granger shook her head and smiled slightly sadly.   - Aren't you going to turn us in? - The Gryffindor girl asked, but caught Ilya's frowning face and immediately apologized. - I'm sorry, I forgot you don't tattletale.   - "I'm not going to be able to do that. - I was in the middle of a conversation with him.   - W-where? - the girl was confused.   - To the abattoir. Pomfrey's, of course!   - You can't," Granger shook her head and her tail vigorously, expressing a high degree of denial. - I can't," Granger shook her head and wagged her tail vigorously, expressing a high degree of denial. I'd have to wait - the effects of the potion would wear off in half an hour.   Ilya bowed his head sideways, then sighed heavily and grabbed the girl's soft, furry paw.   - You're smart, but you're also stupid," the boy wailed, guiding the girl away from the bathroom. She had no chance to match the Slytherin in physical strength. - If you add an animal tail to a werewolf, the effect isn't going to be overpowering. That's how Animagia used to be taught - a crash course for daredevils. I culled my pet, brewed some potions, knocked back a few shots, rigged a couple of rituals, and voila, in six months you're an Animagus. The main thing is not to get stuck on the road in a state like you.   The girl stopped stammering and then blushed a little, Granger always did that when she remembered something important that she'd managed to forget. Suddenly the girl flashed her catlike eyes.   - How do you know?   - I won't tell," Ilya shrugged quietly.   The girl immediately began to balk.   - You can't go to Pomfrey, she'll find out!   - She will," Weasel nodded agreeably. - But only what I tell her. And I'll tell her this. Like, all the girls from first to third year have already had time to kiss me on the cheek, on the lips, or fondle me, and you have not. So I got on your nerves in the most brazen way, you hit me with some kind of spell, from which the boil on the most expensive pops up. I was going to turn you into a cat in retaliation, but I'm not good at transfiguration, so I did what I did.   Danger wanted to object, but swallowed her unspoken objection.   - You'll be expelled.   - Pfft," Weasel snorted. - I've gotten away with a lot more than that, and so have a lot of others. The Headmaster never expelled anyone in his career. It wasn't like him.   - You'll be stripped of all your faculty points, and Snape will kill you.   - They can't. Points can only be withdrawn upon capture. Or within half an hour of being caught. And since I haven't even laid a finger on you, the magic clock won't accept the request. I've learned from the experience of Mournful Week.   - Then you'll have to do your chores! - The girl would not let up, but she was no longer stubborn, but followed the leader obediently.   - Of course they will," the boy hummed. - And Professor Flitwick's cookies are so good...   A couple of students had already almost made it up to the hospital wing, for the good of the stairs continued to behave quite decently. And because of the festivities, not a soul was visible in the castle. If you could hold a tank division here, no one would notice. So what half a girl, half a cat.   - I'll owe you one, won't I? - sad and doomed, the girl asked as the hospital door loomed at the end of the corridor.   Weasel pretended to think about it, then waved his hand.   - No," he stretched out. - It's Christmas, so consider my services a gift.   - Who are you, and where did Ilya go? - The girl was clearly parodying Ilya's own tone, which she did quite decently.   The guys stopped at the door and weasel was about to knock, when suddenly a pirate smile spread on his face, the same one that sometimes made the older girls blush.   - I'm not gonna be Scary Square's Ilya Ilya all my life.   - Then what will you be?   - A world-famous rock star," the boy's eyes gleamed dreamily. - And when I mean 'world-famous,' I mean that I'll be known by muggles and wizards alike.   -Yeah, of course," the girl snorted, showing him what she thought about it.   - Believe it or not," Weasel grimaced. - But that's the way it's going to be. And when I'm King of the Rock, you'll have to ask me for a signature on my chest as payment.   Ilya paused, and Hermione blushed thickly even through her hair. Then the boy swept his gaze over the Gryffindor's figure, and smiled his other smile, a smile that usually didn't bode well.   - If you grow one, of course," the young man added.   Hermione froze and began to blush with girlish anger and resentment already. Before anything irreparable happened, Ilya whistled daintily and kicked open the doors of the hospital wing.   - Madam Pomfrey! - The Slytherin bellowed at full force. - Accept the error of genetic engineering!   (p.a. don't forget to feed the author with comments before you go) Chapter 18   February 17, 1993. Hogwarts.       The holidays flew by as quickly as possible. It was like snapping your fingers and having to put on your patched study robe and go to class again. But you couldn't say that almost a month without compulsory classes had gone in vain. Not at all, in any case, Ilya has almost learned to grow a tail. And if you think that you grow a tail is easy, then try it. And even if you're a great magician, you will still be hampered by the fact that no tail you have not had since some week of the embryonic stage. So the kid was struggling with Animagia rituals.   When he didn't need to 'animagitate' Weasel would occasionally hang around the castle, idly strolling and indulging in absolutely nothing to do. After all, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to wander the quiet staircases, which had gone into hibernation and weren't planning on helping the lad in the matter of his broken neck. If bored of that as well, the young man would head for the hospital wing. There, as usual, the Golden Trio spent the day and night. Danger, because Pomfrey was reversing the transformation, which wasn't quick, and Shaggy and Ginger, because they couldn't imagine themselves without their friend.    Ilya was constantly making fun of the Griffins. They were pissed off, and often tried to curse the Slytherin. But at the most crucial moment, when the spells were ready to fly off his wands, the healer appeared. With her stern, unyielding voice of an operating surgeon, she kicked all visitors out. Weasley and Potter walked out as if they were drenched in water, and Ilya, laughing, ran off in some unknown direction so they couldn't get to him.    But even such entertainments quickly became tiresome. So, armed with Baby, Ilya began to sit in his den and play for long periods of time. He played almost everything he remembered, what he knew and what he could not remember and had never heard. Weasel had a firm, unshakable feeling that the music he was playing already existed somewhere. That is, he wasn't inventing it at all, but simply relaying it, like a well-tuned receiver. And he liked it, liked the feeling of jumping headfirst into a cool spring and taking a little piece of it with him when he came up. Ilyen liked to play, but there were some blank spots in his music lately, it was not making sense, there was something missing in it and Ilyen couldn't understand what it was missing. He was continuing to do the same things he had been doing before, but the feeling of inferiority wouldn't leave him. For some time Ilya kept wrestling with this puzzle until he decided that when the time comes the answer will find it.    Ilya was also reading, a lot of reading, because Flitwick and Dumbledore had most likely conspired to give the orphan books. But not textbooks, works or scientific materials, and not Muggle literature, but the very real magic books. Have you ever heard of the fairy tales of Bard Beale? Of course you have, who hasn't? Well, the books that the boy got were older than these fairy tales, but they described such events that were not described anywhere else. Have you heard of Troy? Silly question though, but did you know that in that war great mages, dragons, dwarves (yes, yes!) and many other intelligent people with magical blood running in their veins fought. Had they heard of Alexander? But did you know that the lords of the elements, the spirits of wind and earth walked with him? What do you know about the Vikings? And about their shamans and rituals, how they made friends with lightning and fraternized with the sea?   What Flitwick and Dumbledore presented was called the Ancient Annals. Obviously, they were not the original "Chronicles", since they - the originals - lay in the museum of the main office of the International Confederation of Mages. That, if Ilya wasn't mistaken, was somewhere in Greece.   The most amazing thing was that the annals were translated into a beautiful literary language that some Muggle writers would have envied, and certainly none of today's mages had a command of the word at that level. While the boy was gaping at the stories, real stories that really happened thousands of years ago, he literally saw these epic battles. Seen the mysteries of magic, similar to the finest, high quality fantasy, but at the same time - absolutely authentic and real. Seen dramas that can't be compared to the tragedy of the two sons of Capuletti and Montecchi. Seen riddles so complex and unfathomable that they would take ten years to unravel. Watched journeys that were full of danger, hardship and true friendship. Ilya was discovering history from a very different angle, one in which magic is not a fiction or a myth, but a very real and weighty figure.    But, alas, there were three weeks in the vacation, and the boy devoured "Chronicles" in a week and a half, reading from dawn to the last star. Of course, Ilya was going to reread the stories he liked, but the second time was not the same pleasure. Gone was the interest of obscurity, the interest when you do not know what lies ahead. All that remained was to enjoy the language and the story itself, and that was a little less than I wanted.    Weasel himself also made gifts for the professors. He gave Flitwick, not surprisingly, another book. This time, without any wisecracks, he gave Tolkien, and all at once - a collection of works. And to Dumbledore Ilya fitted a new vase for sugar wedges, as well as returned the wedges, which he stole at the beginning of the year. If you ask how Ilya did it, he'll send you to the prosecutor, because "you can't prove anything, you shitty investigator!"   So the new academic term started very positively. However, on the first of February, on the first day of school, there was a scandal. Potter and Weasley were robbed blind. Clearly, the scandal was blamed on Ilya, who spent a lot of time at Vulture. It's understandable - they have the most fun girls and the most trump fireplace. But Ilya, seeing the mess that went on in the bedroom sophomores after a spear, said with absolute adamant that he does not work so dirty. And if weasel wanted to steal something from the bespectacled boy and his buddy, they would have known about it at least a week after the disappearance.   When Ilya tried to find out what exactly had been taken from the Trio, it turned out to be a diary. From the description, the Slytherin realized that it was the Wizard's Diary. Except it was a very bearded version. If Illya had the "v14.2" model. Then there was most likely a rarity, numbered "v 1.1". Anyway, one way or the other, the training went on. In the castle, after the events of last year, the atmosphere had calmed down a bit. Potter was still bypassed, but it was obvious that after the holidays people had relaxed. And there were no other incidents.    And now Ilya, putting his textbook in his bag as he went, was running to his Char class. He had to stay up so late studying Runes in the evening that he forgot to set his alarm clock. He slept through breakfast, and a hungry Ilya is a disgruntled Ilya.    With the students the castle came to life, and with the castle the stairs woke up. He jumped over the first one without looking, and when he got to the edge, he pushed himself off and soared in a mind-blowing leap. Had he not done so, he would have found himself in a moment at the dead end of the first floor. And so Prornyra landed on another staircase that led to the second - to the classrooms. However, this wooden old lady didn't want to hang still either.    It creaked, squeaked, and moved sideways. Ilya ran upstairs, but the last five steps simply evaporated. The young man mentally cursed and sighed. A step disappeared beneath other students on occasion, but it was so rare and harmless that it looked more like a caring aunt's joke. But with Ilya, the story was quite different. He jumped up and landed, with feline grace, on the railing, and then ran up and over the blackening cliff again.    He was able to get his balance back when he landed on a rocky ledge, but he swayed and almost tumbled down. Turning around, Ilya suddenly bent his right arm at the elbow, and then forcefully struck his left arm on the bend. Such an indecent gesture, accompanied by a victorious grin, was directed at the stairs. They even creaked with indignation. But this creak Ilya did not catch, as he had already rushed forward down the corridor. Today they were to undergo a "conditioned combat spell, according to the classification of the leader of Scary Square's youngest gang, Ilya." And the creator of his own, nowhere else known classification, didn't want to be late for class. If only because Flitwick doesn't like it when people are late, and today they should have a "class"...   - Bom-Bom-Bom!" the bell tolled.   - Why, you fucker," the boy wheezed and kicked the armor with force, which clinked indignantly.    He was now facing another unconsciousness and a new batch of killing elixirs. There was a silver lining, though, in that he no longer had to run. If in the woods he could run for twenty-four hours, then running in a castle was as tiring for him as for any other student.    Ilya stopped, adjusted the knotted bandanna, and quietly went on. If in January the castle looked like an abandoned coal mine, now it seemed to glow from within. Everything glittered, breathed and sparkled with new colors. As if spring came for the stone giant and it was ready for the feast of life and soul.   Stopping in front of the door, the Slytherin gathered more air in his chest and knocked quietly, then opened the door. The amphitheater was already packed to the brim with Professor Flitwick standing by the blackboard.   - Come in, Mr. Ilya," nodded the master of spells. - Minus five points for being late.    Weasel grimaced a little, but made his way to his rightful place. Outside the window everything was covered in a white shroud, and the forest snorted slightly, occasionally dropping white, fluffy clumps of snow. Ilya, taking out his school supplies, turned away from the window. He did not like winter, and especially the snow.    There was a deathly silence in the classroom, as there always was in applied magic classes. Only the teacher's voice made you believe that you were not in a wax museum, but in a lecture. On a green cloth one could already see white lines of drawings, patterns, calculations and deduced formulae. Next to it, in brackets, was a transcription, and underneath, a scheme of sweeps. A very simple scheme, I should say. It was only a downward movement, and at the very end, at the lowest point, one had to make a zig-zag.    - So, now that we're all here, I'll begin our lesson. Today we're going to look at a destructive spell. I'll warn you right away that these spells are quite dangerous, and you shouldn't throw them around, because they can easily harm a living creature. So, who would like to answer and elaborate on these spells?   You've already guessed which student raised his hand first, haven't you? So it was, Granger raised her hand as if a star was playfully hovering above her somewhere, beckoning the walking encyclopedia to herself. Besides the Gryffindor girl, several other hands went up in class, but it was obvious that the people were timid to respond.   - Please, Miss Granger.   The girl rose from her seat and cocked her nose slightly. It seemed that what attracted Danger most in her studies was the opportunity to pedal her erudition. No, Ilya was positively assured that this lady just needed a good dose of hormones.    - The Difindo spell belongs to the category of authorized combat charms. It was first used in 243 B.C. at the battle of the Roman Legion against the Germanic tribes. It is believed that with a certain amount of strength, these enchantments can destroy anything. The enchantments are multifunctional, despite their ease and simplicity.    Ilya sighed dejectedly. Maybe Granger was a distant relative of Beans? The history professor, by the way, was the only ectoplasmic Ilya was okay with. Beans didn't even smell like the other ghosts. Probably because the historian never realized he was dead. And if the spell of sleep Beans can still resist, but when the mouth opened Hermione, knocked out clean. The weasel only with a great effort of will prevented his eyes from closing.    - Well done, Miss Granger," a smiling Flitwick clapped. - Ten points for Gryffindor.   Yeah, Gryffindor must be dancing a jig in his grave every time he gets a score. No, listen to how that sounds. It sounded like they were really giving points to dead wizards. Ilya shook his head tiredly. It is winter. In summer and spring his sarcasm usually sleeps, lounging in the warm rays of the caressing sun. But in the winter, when the sky darkens and the wind blows frosty, he's always tempted to pick on someone and poke fun at them.    The professor, meanwhile, supplemented the student's speech with all sorts of colorful examples. For example, he advised against using these charms to cut the skirts of female students. The boys blushed somehow, and Ilya realized that indeed the home English people are melting down, it's time for them all to go out. Flitwick even gave an example in which a spunky young man, forgetting the necessary domestic charms, tried to undress a lady with the help of Diffindo. The lady ended up spending two weeks in a hospital wing. Geu chuckled, he knew those household spells. And judging by the way Greengrass and Zabini looked at him angrily, they hadn't forgotten about them either. Ilya knew that someday they would try to get revenge, even if it was ten years from now. But snakes always had their revenge.   There were also some funny, amusing, but at the same time - instructive stories in which the spells of destruction appeared. In fact, there were quite a few of these very spells of destruction. "Bombarda, BombardaMaksima, Esplosion, Blackus, Firbis, Egoidio, Seko, Stupirus, Gelmino, Gemsion, Turpado" and on and on and on. But the trick was that all of the above enchantments had a narrow purpose. Some for skin splitting, some for stone, some for iron, some for fire, some for breaking the integrity of ice, the same Blackus simply created a nasty explosion on the spot, but if you look closely, these enchantments destroyed the structure of the "atmosphere". And many of the spells like Blackus, Explosion, Seco, or Turpado were either quite complicated or classed as dark. But Diffindo, a simple Diffindo studied at school, could destroy anything, drawing power from the mage in proportion to the "cost" of the object.    Okay, you'd have to be another Merlin to diffind a magical artifact. And to diffind a piece of paper, you could be born a squib. It's more complicated with living things. It's harder to lay a diphindo on a magical creature, but it's easier to lay it on ordinary people. It's not a problem to put a spell on a creature with magic blood, but it's easier to put a spell on an ordinary person. The young man on his machine calculated that he could seriously cut a person with them three, maybe four times, after which he would get too tired and might even pass out.   I was a bit easier to learn Seko, a conditional dark curse that had been specifically sharpened to do harm. I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight. But the thing was, Ilya didn't want that. Become "strong" with the help of dark spells, anyone can, who has in his head at least detsle gray substance. But to achieve recognition in the warrior cause in other ways, it is already much more difficult. And Ilya knew that the easy way is not always the right one. Sometimes you don't have to go around the mountain, but to climb it, knocking your hands to meat, wiping your teeth in dust and pulling your veins like guitar strings.    During the reflection, the lecture flew by very quickly, and Flitwick, with a wave of his wand, levitated sheets of ordinary A4 paper onto the desks of the students. Illya even felt homesick for the white cloths, not at all like the hard yellow scrolls of parchment. But let's not deny, feathers and parchment had their charm and without them Hogwarts would be something else. Less fabulous and far more boring. He was willing to write on papyrus. In addition, for him worked self-writing pen, which was the envy of many peers. Ha, let them continue to envy, they would not have the nerve to score a bet with crazy maniac and member of the junta Snakeordogogo. It's true that weasel himself didn't know about these little nuances at the time, but who's going to remember that now.   - As always, if anyone fails to master enchantments by the end of the lesson," Flitwick moved from his makeshift pedestal of piled books to his desk, where he sat in a small armchair. - I strongly recommend that you train them yourself. The more time you spend practicing, the better your chances of success in the magical arts. Theory is good, but you should not forget about practice. Now get to it, and, please, let's dispense with the emergency call for Madam Pomfrey today.    The air, as it had been before, trembled with the flapping, and whispers and even shouts of formula were heard everywhere. Ilya, without thinking, waved his wand, uttered a magic word that resembled little more than "Please. The paper trembled, flickered, and soon there were clear lines in the center. He lifted the paper by the edge, and a two-dimensional figure of a swallow spreading its wings was left on the table. Yes, the boy did miss flying a little, but this year's winter was too frosty and only a loon would be dispersing over the ground at this time, where it was even colder and windier.    Ilya did not demonstrate his success, as he was not drawn to showing off in winter, and Flitwick would not give points anyway. Breaking the school routine, evading law enforcement (in the person of the Head of the Hoz), all this prevented the dwarf from awarding points for practice to the Slytherin. And the professor only asked Ilya for theory if he raised his hand.    He put his hand on his head and watched the class. Some panted without any success, some paper crumpled and twisted like a partisan under interrogation. Some managed to make a small tear, the most dexterous ones a cut...   - Bravo, Miss Granger! - an exclamation from the master of enchantments sounded. Weasel looked at the front row and saw that in front of Danger lay two identical pieces of paper that had once been one. - Twenty points to Gryffindor for excellent magic!   Hermione was going to get drunk tonight - thirty in one class wasn't like picking a troll's nose with a wand. Although, Danger's a pai girI, so no booze. She'll probably be happy to read an encyclopaedia. How did her mother ever find a husband? Although, the elders at the orphanage said that domestic, calm girls dandelion, in bed (if you know which "levers to pull") turn into the most real badasses without any gateways.    Granger sat down at the table, flashing a smile full of superiority. Maybe she had complexes or something. Ilya was still sitting idly, twirling the lighter in his fingers. There was already a rune on it, a tiny little junior rune. In fact, last week he had completed the Junior Alphabet and moved on to the Senior Alphabet. But even one of the Older symbols was so complex that the pattern alone would make him dizzy.    As soon as I remembered the runes, there was an incredible explosion, a crackling sound, some shouting and even shrieking everywhere. There was wood dust in the air, and sharper sawdust in the ceiling.   - The Shahids are undermining! - Ilya wailed, wielding his wand and conjuring... ...conjuring something. - Jihad attacks! Hovyj!   With these words, Ilya swallowed swiftly into the passage, rolled out of the line of possible fire and lurked behind the knight's armor at the very bottom of the audience. Weasel was already expecting a new series of explosions, could literally hear the machine-gun trill and the song of bared curved daggers. As well as shouts in some incomprehensible, but belligerent language. But nothing happened. Perhaps after the explosion, most of the "infidels" are dead, and the terrorists themselves are concussed. Ilya quickly conjured up a fireball the size of a mandarin, which had the trouble of exploding weakly when it touched the surface, and threw it across his armor.   - Fire in the hole! - shouted Ilya.   There was a loud "hiss" and then an audible clap. So there are mages among the terrorists who know how to neutralize other people's elemental fire spells. It gets worse and worse, the bearded ones are completely out of their mind. And then Ilya realized that he was sort of in a magic school...   - Mr. Ilya," came a mocking, cawing voice. - How about a truce?   Chief White Feather would not be Chief White Feather if he allowed himself to be confused in this situation.    - And on what terms? - without coming out of hiding, the boy asked.   - Cookie?   - Kilo!   - Paul.   - Two more cakes, then.   - Your contributions do not serve the interests of our people.   - But you're the one who suggested a truce.   There was silence.   - And two brownies," came a chuckling but ostensibly heavy sigh.    - I'm going out," Ilya answered.   First the black bandanna with the image of Jolly Roger on it appeared from behind the armor, and then the guy himself. Everyone who stepped back after the explosion and the little show began to burst into laughter. A few seconds later Ilya was laughing along with them. There was no terrorist attack, just that Shaggy, as he sometimes does, put too much power into his charms. Now not only was there no two meter long piece of the first row in front of him, but the castle masonry had been ripped apart all the way down to the magic stones that neutralized Harry the Tank-Potter's enchantments.    Flitwick, who had neutralized Ilya's bombshell a few minutes ago, had tidied up the classroom in three strokes and rebuilt everything that had been destroyed. It was like a one-man repair crew.   - Bom-Bom-Bom!" the bell rang, drowning out the laughter and banter of the students.   - I think there's no shame in finishing our lesson on that cheerful note," the goblin smiled predatory at some point. - Who never managed to cope with the task - don't despair, if you try your best, you will definitely succeed. Mr. Potter, I recommend you to train outside. The air is cleaner there, and destroying anything is somewhat problematic.   - Yes, Professor," the crimson bespectacled man muttered to himself.    - That's it for today, don't forget to practice.   The students began to pack their things and, hiding their laughter, leave the classroom. Ilya gathered himself with the help of levitation charms, as he was too lazy to go upstairs. Leaving the classroom, he smiled at the charms master who winked at him. Outside the door, the vultures were already waiting for him. The Slytherins, understandably, weren't going to waste their time on the dirty girl.    - Ilya, how are you? Not badly hurt by the shelling? - Isabelle giggled.   - Gunfire? - Ilya spoke with a strong Arabic accent. - What are you talking about, you innocent, come on, I'll do evil to you!   And Ilya chased after the laughing girl, trying to catch her by the waist.             March 4, 1993 Hogwarts            With March came the dripping. Many even complained that it was hard to sleep with the constant noise of melting snow. And near the castle, on the still brown, frozen ground, there were now only patches of grey snow. And in the morning and in the evening in the glitter of frozen puddles one could find a reflection of the waking sun. It threw off its gray, dark, unpleasant cover and illuminated everything around with its gentle light.    The forest was waking up along with the celestial light. It shook off the white fuzz, exposing the branches that were still bare. But already you could hear the still somewhat empty, but nevertheless lively creaking of the centuries-old trees. Birds came in from wintertime, bringing with them their singing and incessant hissing. Flyers excitedly told each other about countries they had seen and about seas they had managed to cross. And animals, slowly, began to take interest in their surroundings, more and more often running through the meadows, not hiding in the shadows and warming among the cooling rocks.    - You've been in too good a mood lately," Lavender poked Ilya in the shoulder.   The young man swayed, and then, bending down sharply, blew on the girl's ear, causing her to shriek.   - That's what I'm talking about," Brown pretended to pout.   - What nasty thing are you up to? - Parvati, walking a little ahead, asked.   - Why is it disgusting at first," he said indignantly.   - Because you're always like that when you plan to pull another stunt," one of the Indian twins shrugged.   - Or maybe I'm just in a good mood.   - You can tell McGonagall when she starts crucifying you again," chuckled the cheerful, beaming McGoogall.    - You're mean," Ilya muttered. - I'm going to throw you to your classmates to eat.   - You can't do that! - The girls shrieked together.   - He was all blushy and almost choked on his tongue, and we thought it was trouble to take him to Madam Pomfrey. - He was blushing and choking on his tongue, and we thought he was in trouble, so we had to take him to Madam Pomfrey.   - And Potter?   - And Potter and Weasley are occupied by Granger," Lavender snorted.   Danger never really fit in amongst her peers, or rather those were a year or so younger than her, but whatever. In her second year, among the ladies, Granger remained in the exclusion zone.    - There's also Dean and Seamus," the Slytherin objected.   - Who only have one thing on their mind.   - Nih... No way," Ilya whistled. - They're only twelve! Even I didn't think much of it when I was their age. That's all they've got.   Ilya interrupted because the sophomores suddenly blushed and looked away.   - I think we're talking about different things.   - They're always making out," Patil muttered.   - Oh," Ilya stretched and scratched the back of his head. - Somehow I missed it.   - Yeah.   There was an awkward silence. Or rather, awkwardness was experienced by the ladies, and Ilya tried not to laugh. The situation was indeed comical, and he realized that not everyone was as spoiled as the wards of St. Frederic's orphanage. However, the company had already made it to the door of the transfiguration class. There were still a couple of minutes left before class, but the boys decided not to play dangerous games with the Dean of Scarlet and so went inside. Transfiguration this time was after lunch and there were no latecomers. On the contrary, people had gathered in the auditorium beforehand.    Ilya nodded to his mates and staggered off to his place of exile. Granger, in her usual way, had everything she could get her hands on. Ilya sat down on the very edge, taking out a textbook, a sheet of parchment, and a quill, which Danger looked at like a wandering wanderer in the desert, for a glass of water. The girl's hands were perpetually covered in ink, which sometimes got on her face or clothes. It didn't look very pleasant, every time she was tempted to advise Hermione to go to the ladies' room after class instead of scurrying around the castle with traces of "scholastic glory". Ilya had always felt squeamish about people who didn't look after themselves and allowed themselves to look untidy or slovenly. But then again, it was his childhood spent at the orphanage and on the pavement of Scary Square that was to blame for such frowns. There Ilya had learned even from a shabby, tattered T-shirt to make something that would not cause momentary disgust. To look good, dignified and beautiful, that was the dream of all the neighborhood and shelter bozos. And it was especially what she dreamed of when she saw the kids driving across the highway that led to the suburbs. These children with rich parents, always throwing glances full of squeamishness, contempt and arrogance, as if boasting of their fortunate birth. So weasel sincerely did not tolerate those who, having opportunities, did not use them, taking them for granted.    Soon the professor appeared in the classroom. She looked, as always, as if she had swallowed an iron pin. Her back was perfectly straight, her shoulders squared, her chin upturned, and her gaze steely. It was as if she was saying that she would not tolerate no disobedience and that everything she said was absolute. Anybody who argued with her was a troublemaker who must be dealt with at once. Unpleasant woman.   - Today we're wrapping up the topic of transmutation of the living into the nonliving," McGonagall went straight to the point. - The rest of the class will be devoted to transfiguration spells. But they will not form part of the exam, in which you will need to demonstrate 'only' transfiguration skills. Miss Granger, if you would be so kind as to hand out the study material.    The nerd stood up, and proudly strode to the table, where there was a cage with two dozen white mice. Five minutes later, a furry beast flaunted in front of each one, clearly soothed by some kind of charm. A mouse can't be indifferently washing its paws and rubbing its ears when a glowing wand is pointed at it.    - Try to turn an object into something constructive. If you cannot make a multi-component object, please, practice turning it into a goblet. You will have a similar task on your exam.   The people lit up with genuine enthusiasm and began to make magic. Ilya, wondering what to make, looked around. Many of them had quite passable cups, mugs and something in between. Ron was the only one who stood out: he wanted to make some sort of fancy cup, but it came out furry and with a tail. It looked funny. Potter was not very good at transfiguration, so he made a drunken stooge. Muddy glass, cracks and all. Maybe Shaggy really was a drunken teenager.   Malfoy didn't do too well, but the blond was, it was fair to say, quite adept at potions, but otherwise not much better than the average student. Neville, as usual, failed, except that the mouse began to cast aluminum. Granger, on the other hand, was panting, Ilya guessed, over a Rubik's cube. In any case, she had already succeeded in making some semblance of it out of the mouse. Magic is a very convenient thing, one does not need to know the composition and structure of an object, one just wants to transform something into something. It is as if the universe itself creates transmutation, which has information about everything in this universe.    Ilya concentrated and bit his lip it must have taken a lot of effort, but the young man wanted to see if a mouse could become a cannon. With a wave of his wand, a long formula, and there on the table in front of the boy lay a black beretta. Just like Agent 007, judging by the book covers. Maybe Ilyas will get an Aston Martin, and a slutty Russian beauty at the same time. It is possible not very slutty, but it must be Russian, they say that every lady there is the epitome of beauty.   - Ilya!" wailed the Dean of Scarlet. - What is it?   - Tough question," the Scary Square wizard patted himself on the chin. - A moment ago, it was a little mouse.    The class stood still and watched another spectacle. Rarely was a lesson without a clash between the Iron Lady and the Weasel. And the young man himself was not averse to ending this eternal strife, but old McGee seemed to hate him more and more every day. And she looked at him as if she saw someone else, someone she knew and hated.   - But now it's a gun!   - You're very observant, ma'am.   - Minus five points for rudeness," the castle's chief lioness snorted catlike. - Why did you turn the mouse into a gun?   - To prove it," Ilya shrugged.   - Prove... what?   - That a mouse is a great weapon! Imagine if some evil man kidnapped you. Strip you down to your underpants and put you in a cesspool somewhere. What do you do, you ask? And everyone will remember the cute guy Ilya and his mouse-gun. Prisoner will catch a rat, weld it AK-47 and go to the great cause of self-rescue.    - You're full of crap.   - Are you talking about the kidnapper taking the wand and having nothing to conjure with? - there was laughter in the classroom. - Yeah, that's where I'm slacking. Tactics aren't fully worked out yet.    The professor snorted again and waved her wand. A mouse appeared on the table in Beretta's place. It shook its head in surprise, and then, except for waving its paw, started washing. Ilya, without thinking twice, stretched his lips in a pirate grin and grabbed the squeaky brute and pointed it at the dean.   - Bang, bang!" shouted Weasel.    There was evident laughter in the audience. From the look on McGonagall's crooked face, she didn't approve. The Iron Lady folded her arms across her chest and flashed her eyes angrily as she adjusted her glasses.    - Put the mouse on the table and leave the classroom.   The young man stroked the animal and carefully transferred it directly to Danger's textbook. The girl stared dumbfoundedly at her white-haired guest. Throwing the case with Baby on his shoulders, Ilya stowed the accessories in his bag and went out. At the door he turned around.   - Points?   - Ten points to Slytherin for good witchcraft.   - Goodbye.   Out into the corridor, the boy leaned his back against the wall and almost slid down it. The sorcery had taken too much energy, and Ilya felt as if he'd just had a hard workout with iron. His body ached, and everything in front of his eyes began to dance wildly.    After breathing a little, Weasel moved on, becoming more and more convinced that Transfiguration was not for him.          May 7, 1993, Hogwarts.           This evening, the Gryffindor Lounge was quite noisy and crowded. Almost the entire faculty was there, and in addition, many of the seniors from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. And no, this was not a meeting to discuss a conspiracy against snakes. It was simply that a certain Ilya, had been arranged to play the guitar. This time the kid was pretty much rebuffed, because he was becoming more and more convinced that his music was missing something. And now, when he was playing his compositions instead of the learned riffs, he understood that he needed to add something, but what for... The lack of understanding brought a real heartache, because the guy was no longer confident in his musical abilities. And, to be frank, it had been a year since music had become the main thing in Weasel's life. He could no longer see himself without the guitar's chime and strings, beneath the horny pads of his fingers.    But the students had enough of this "inferiority". Spread out on the chairs, on the floor, on some people's laps and even on their shoulders, people listened to the cheerful and sad, lyrical and martial, to everything that was produced by fast running fingers. Ilya, closing his eyes, was trying to find that little pinch that would return the music to its former sound.   - Ilya! - George shouted. - And let's have ours.   - Yeah, come on! - The other boys supported him.   Ilya nodded and began to play one of his own compositions, which was loved by the whole castle. Surprisingly, it was the first tune the musician had written and Ilya did not suppose that it could win the hearts so easily. By the way, Pronyra didn't know the notes, so his musical records were like the ciphers of MI6, which even a brilliant cryptologist wouldn't yield to. Even the devil could not figure out these dots, numbers, and commas. And Ilya kept playing, telling in his song about forest girls, who disappeared in the tree crowns, but really liked flirting with a traveler. The melody was light, airy and permeated with spring mood, full of lingering expectation and recounting glances and sighs. The girls, covering their eyes, smiled at their thoughts, and the lads, bolder, pressed closer or hugged their relaxed girlfriends harder.    Illya liked the atmosphere - spring had reached the castle, and everyone had forgotten about the monster that lurked in the depths of the magical fortress. Never mind death when your lover cast a glance at the long-haired snivel over there. What are we horrified if the guy you're dreaming of clutching a teddy bear still hasn't invited you to Hogsmeade.    Hogwarts was full of real, genuine life, and Ilya could feel the shackles of winter's cold leaving him, and the eternal fire inside him waking up. His fingers raced over the strings, and the song, "Hide and Seek with the Leaves," changed to something else.    Something new, but familiar to anyone who has ever dreamed of another person. Except that Ilya, this evening, in his music dreamed of something that could be made up, but could hardly be found. Perhaps he shouldn't have watched that cartoon.   Pork was ringing guitar melodies, and Granger appeared in the living room. Her hair was disheveled and turned into the likeness of a blown up pit. In her hands, the girl held a brush and comb. The lady searched for someone with her gaze for a while, and, most likely not finding one, sighed slightly disappointedly and went to Potter.    Shaggy was sitting next to his team, listening to music as well. Harry didn't even notice his friend approaching him.   - Harry," Hermione whispered softly. - Can you give me a hand?   The hero of magical Britannia flinched, woke up, and nodded smiling. Langer sat down in front of him and the boy began gently brushing his long tresses. His hands moved with the care of a working sapper. The head 'detective' of the school was desperately afraid of hurting his friend. Although, something told Ilya that this cord was a pacifist at all, as fighting was something unacceptable to him. Ilya himself had never refused a good scuffle, as the scars testified.    Ilya, however, had already turned away and concentrated on playing, sinking into the music, trying to find in it the question that plagued him. But he wasn't the only one looking at the pair of friends. From another corner of the living room, clutching a red notebook, a girl named Ginevra Weasley was nervously biting her lips.   The next day, Hermione Granger was found outside the library. She, like the other victims, was completely numb... Chapter 19   May 19, 1993 Hogwarts       - All right, Mudblood, get ready to pack," Malfoy imprinted venomously.   - Draco, is your dad going to get us a pass for that freak's wand fracture surgery? - Daphne asked.   - Of course," Draco nodded. - He'll be headmaster as soon as tomorrow.   - The school will finally be in order," Nott sighed. - At least it'll be a little less stinky without those filthy little girls.   - It'll be less stinky," Ilya grimaced as he got off the couch and left the living room. - When you shut your mouths and don't smell like shit.   Ilya's back was shouted something, probably victoriously sarcastic and vilely derogatory. Ilya, on the other hand, threw his hands behind his head and headed up the stairs, which were once more frozen. But this wasn't the dream that came with the departure of the students, this was the numbness of fear and the aloofness of mourning. After Hermione was hurt, the castle was in for a real coven. For one thing, the next week the Aurors had already shown up at the castle, along with the Minister of Magic. Fudge Ilya had not seen, nor had he seen what had happened at the edge of the forest. And there really was something that had happened there.   Hagrid was detained on suspicion of practicing black magic and discovering the Chamber of Secrets, and sent to Azkaban. And not in the investigative ministerial isolation ward, but directly to the lower levels to the damned Dementors. The next day there were articles in the newspapers, which described as if Fudge himself held a particularly dangerous criminal. But the problems didn't end there. Things were only gaining momentum.   By the tenth, Dumbledore had been kicked out of school. This news thundered throughout the castle, and the echo of the ringing almost took away Ilya's senses. Let us not lie, the boy liked the castle and the fairy atmosphere reigning here, and magic was a cool thing, which I did not want to part with. But events were depressing in their realistic inevitability.   The Board of Trustees, unanimously, dismissed the headmaster, and appointed Lucius Malfoy in his place. So it was all a foregone conclusion - as soon as the administrative deadline passed, the gray-bearded Daedan would leave the castle, as would Ilya and some others who were born with "dirty" blood. And the administrative deadline was coming out tomorrow - exactly ten days after the application. During those days, Dumbledore remained de facto Headmaster, but was not de jure. He was supposed to prepare in those days all the documents and information that would help the new head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.   In general, as you understood, Ilya was in a bad mood. He felt like a bird that had lost its wings. After all the sky (the way out of the situation) is so close, just reach for it, just make a jerk, but broken wings and dirty feathers (duty and principles) got in the way. Ilya was mad about the fact that he was able to solve all problems easily and effortlessly, and even to return Hagrid from the dungeon, but what he had gained in these two years did not allow him. Namely an inner core. No, not the one that did not allow him to bend under the weight of the world, Ilya had always had, but a new core. One that would ensure that you would never betray yourself, never do something that would make you ashamed to look in the mirror.   Potter and Weasley walked past, excited, frightened, and discouraged. They weren't even paying attention to their classmate when they went down to Weeping Myrtle's bathroom floor. Ilya grinned - at least someone was relatively lucky. When Granger had ended up in the hospital, the castle had stopped leering at Potter, and many had even apologized for the redolent thoughts and rumors about Shaggy. No one doubted that the bespectacled man would even in theory dare to harm his friend. So the recent outcast once again put on a shining armor, a white plume and turned into the former, sparkling with honor and dignity Hero.   Ilya climbed the stairs in a despondent manner, and then turned to the sixth floor. He passed by the heavy walls, pressing with their despair, and passed by the color-splitting paintings and blinding tapestries. He avoided looking into the reflections of the armor and bit his lip to the blood, clenched his fists to the point of pain and crunching, but the rod did not bend, and Ilya never listened to the thought of betraying himself. The young man stopped outside Flitwick's office and even raised his fist to knock, but then he dropped his hand involuntarily and staggered onward.   Ilya was afraid, I hate to admit it, but he was afraid that the respected professor might turn out to be an ordinary adult. One who for his own gain would sacrifice what he himself considered to be principled. Ilya couldn't afford to be disappointed in the Master of Char and so he moved on. Yes, most likely Flitwick would have agreed with the boy and wouldn't have let him open his mouth, but Ilya just couldn't, couldn't get over that part of himself. Through the same freak that was born under the hail of Scary Square's beatings and filth. Through the freak that still held a blind defense in the wizard's soul, bristling with poisoned spades and jagged swords.   And the castle all around was losing its airiness, settling with an exorbitant weight on Ilya's shoulders. Where was the fairy tale when you needed it so much, where was the real Hero you were waiting for. Why everything is as it was before, why no one will come and help, why no one will save, pulling by the scruff of the neck out of the darkness. After all, this is a fairy tale, after all, this is a true story. But it wasn't like that, there was only the harsh reality around me. No one would come, no one would help or save. There was no saving in Scary Square, and there was no saving at Hogwarts. Magic didn't separate the two worlds, only shaded one side of the coin against the other. And the world was still the same. The same laws, the same rules, and the utter hopelessness of his own stubbornness, as an adult would say, and resilience, as another almost fourteen-year-old boy raised on adventure novels would say.   Ilya stopped and sat down right on the cold stone floor, so ancient and so soulless towards those who are not. There was only emptiness around Ilya. An icy, dehydrating emptiness. There were no people here, though the corridor was popular, the picture frames were empty, and the ghosts flew around just beyond the floor.   Stupid, yes, to fight with yourself, for those who don't give a damn about you. But Ilya couldn't do it any other way, now he couldn't. Probably for nothing, "could not," but it could not change, could not break what was hardened in the soul. Just as it was impossible to wipe the epochal mountain peaks into dust, it was impossible to make Ilya change his decision.   And yet that ugly, selfish, vile man, who knew nothing of honor, conscience, morality, principles, kept whispering with his ugly voice about what you couldn't hear, what you couldn't know. Ilya was not a beautiful, made-up prince, he was a real monster that was wrapped in a beautiful, shiny wrapper and that was another of the young man's pains. He didn't want to be a monster from a messy reality, he wanted to be a prince from a beautiful, made-up fairy tale, but he didn't want to be a prince, he wanted to remain what he was - a freak from Scary Square. They were two parts of him, the same, equal, equal and merged with each other, in a close intertwining of endless tossing and turning. At the first, the young man wondered, who was he? But this was reality, not a fairy tale, and there was no one around to answer that question.   And then there was a deafening rumble and the clatter of stones against stones. Ilya opened his eyes. In front of him stood a huge kite, about twenty meters long and two wide. The snake's head, the size of a passenger car, was pockmarked with stone cover and drenched in dark, almost black, blood. The ancient, nearly two-thousand-year-old basilisk was beating its own head against the wall until it finally froze. The young man got up, they were in pain - both the serpent and the prince.   - You must be braver than I am," the boy smiled, holding out his hand.   The serpent lowered his head and touched the musician's calloused, rough, working palm with his nostrils-stripes. And Ilya, obeying the prince and unafraid, looked where death lived. He looked into the basilisk's eyes. Probably not many had seen them. But they were beautiful. You thought they were red? You were wrong. That they were green? Wrong again. Emerald? Wrong again. They were the color of the dawn sky, some of them were inky blue and the other was scarlet pink. Beautiful eyes that looked like... well, like nothing at all. The young man swiped at the green scales that should have left a scratch on the diamond, but didn't even scratch the boy's skin.   - It sucks for us, doesn't it? - Ilya smirked. - You're in bondage to people, and I'm in bondage to me.   The serpent hissed, Ilya didn't understand him.   - I'm sorry, eyes," Ilya sighed, and bit his lip, which was already bleeding in spurts. - You saved me, but I can't save you. I'm too weak. Potter would have helped, but he's an idiot.   The serpent hissed again, Ilya again did not understand anything, but felt a little lighter. Suddenly, the young man felt something vile enveloping the serpent, something fierce awakening in his eyes. The words were regaining their power, the basilisk couldn't resist the order for long.   - I'm sorry," Ilya repeated, taking his hand away. - But I assure you, I will treasure this gift, and I won't die until I reach for what I want to reach for. I won't forget what you did for me. And I'm sorry again for being such a wuss.   The jaws of the real monster opened, revealing long, crooked, dangerous fangs that a snake should not have. But the eyes, the beautiful eyes, were still serene, as if begging the boy to escape.   - Yes," the boy nodded, adjusting his bandanna and bag. - I'll run. Goodbye, Eyeball. I shall remember. I will.   And the young man darted away. The prince ran as he had once run through the woods, only the wind and the birds could match him in speed. The prince could outrun death, outrun thought and desire. Paintings flashed, merging into the gilded bands of ancient frames. Tapestries blurred into an incredible lake of grayish, faded threads. The prince fled, and the knight's armor, gleamed in a single river of silver and steel. The prince flew and the freak squealed and thrashed in fear, he begged to crouch in a corner and get his wand, feverishly remembering everything that could help protect his life. The fire flew swiftly through the castle, and the man only cowered harder in a dark corner where it was safe and secure, amidst the poisoned spears and crooked swords.   Ilya only stopped when he heard distant whispers. Whether the whispers were paintings, ghosts or people, Ilya did not know, but he heard them:   - Ginny Weasley, it's Ginny Weasley who's been kidnapped.   - They say her skeleton will remain in the Chamber of Secrets for ages.   - Poor Weasley.   The whispers rumbled and rumbled, even though there was nothing around, no pictures, no ectoplasmic, no people. But the sounds were beating from every vent and crevice, as if the wind itself was bringing fragments of phrase to the frozen Slytherin. And then Ilya suddenly laughed. He laughed so long and so gleefully that it sounded like he was going crazy, or just choking.   But weasel could not stop, he laughed and laughed. Not at the situation, not at fate, but at himself. For he - so clever as he thought himself, so deductively gifted as he had naively assumed before, so cunning as he had erred just a few moments before, so clever as he had become convinced time after time that he could not find such a small detail that would avoid so much trouble.   Ilya laughed at himself. At his short-sightedness, his narrow-mindedness, his unwillingness to see what he didn't want to see. Weasel laughed at how much he resembled Harry Potter. And then Ilya ran again. He ran, to the third floor, where the one who can still help him to believe in the fairy tale, who can make so that at the last moment everything suddenly corrects itself and the long-awaited happy ending comes. Ilya rushed to Albus Dumbledore, still headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.   * * *         The path was blocked by a stone gargoyle, as if it had fallen from the heights of Notre Dame de Paris. It was unyielding in its stone callousness. She was fearsome with fangs and claws, and leathery wings that looked as if they were real and not carved in stone. Its lion-like, nasal snout looked without fear as a fierce beast looks at a lost traveler who doesn't even have a lighter torch. The young man was about to ask the monster to step aside, but the gargoyle suddenly raised its stone head and peered intently at the young man. And then, without too much movement, it pulled back behind the wall, exposing the passage to the spiral staircase.   - From me... I'm going to have to do something for the statues," Ilya shouted as he went.   He didn't know what the stone monster might want, but he figured he'd find out. After all, this wizard, running to the headmaster, doesn't forget debts, neither those of others, nor, more importantly, his own.   Weasel didn't even think of stopping in front of the massive mahogany doors. He opened them with a powerful kick and whirled into an oval office, with many fanciful mechanisms. There, by the window, was a desk on massive, carved legs - behind it sat Dumbledore, rubbing his beard anxiously. Opposite, in a miniature armchair, was Flitwick, unequally twirling his wand between his fingers. In the distance could be seen Fawkes' rack and the cupboard on which the Hat lay. Dumbledore broke away from his beard and looked perplexed at the unexpected visitor.   - Ilya? - The Great Light Wizard wondered.   - Director, you fuckin' half-wit, it's late! We've got to get this shit together, but we've got to do it. Fuck...   - Ilya," Flitwick shouted. - Calm down, or we won't understand a word you're saying!   Dumbledore with a wave of his hand created a chair, on which Ilya plunged the same hour. He breathed for a while, with his eyes closed, trying to calm his nerves. When he was agitated, he switched to a gangly accent, which in Hogwarts was understood by few, rather no one except Ilya.   Ten minutes later.   Ilya was on his way back to the castle to pack his things and head for the train. This year ended early, as not only the Quidditch tournament but all the exams had been cancelled. It had been as difficult and dangerous a year as ever for Ilya and, needless to say, he wouldn't have made it on his own. But he will always be grateful to Glazastomu, who helped him out at the last moment. It was probably his first friend in the magical world. A friend who had been one for only a moment, but who had done incommensurably great things in that short space of time.   Ilya knew that the Weasleys were now embracing the hero who had saved their little girl and defeated the terrible monster. He knew that this hero was being honored by many others, but there was another Hero. The one who'd saved just one person.   The school year was ending and Ilya was leaving the fairy tale, which did have a happy ending.    Chapter 20   June 12, 1993, England, The Nora.       Ilya was lying on the beach. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night. The boy wanted to fish in the pond, and now and then he was ruining his sweet slumber with his splashing. The lad wanted to fry the fuck out of them, but Mister for some reason defended the lupo-eyes and for no reason did not want to cook their fish soup. So, lying on a self-made beach in front of a self-made sea, the young man dreamed of sunbathing somewhere in the south, drinking ice-cold fruit juice and enjoying the girls in bikinis.    You might ask where a fourteen year old boy without two months of age got such an urge, even though he looked sixteen-something, the answer was simple: the cinema. Yesterday Ilya had seen the new Bond film and realised that it was summer and he was spending it in a shithole of a world called England. The NZ lying in a trunk in his room would only be enough for a couple of days on the English Channel. All in all, it was a very sordid situation. Not that youngling enjoyed playing with the yearlings, but one of the bears had almost broken his back yesterday. It was not very pleasant. Especially the bear, which the boy almost drowned in the river in a playful revenge.    In a month and a half in Otteri, unlike last year, the young man had grown in size in the shoulders. He had to go to the village to buy new clothes. The salesgirl, a little older during the year, recognized him and even gave him a discount - fifteen pounds, which, in principle, is not so little. By the way, recognized the young man also Pharaohs, who ran after the offender throughout the village. The wizard, who had grown exponentially in height and breadth, stronger and faster, amused himself by teasing the men, even allowing himself to be touched at times, but the next moment he was running away to slow down again. Ilya didn't even feel the weight of the guitar case that invariably rested behind his back.   Ilya also started smoking. Why, you may ask? Just because the image needed a twist, plus all the seniors in the orphanage smoked, so the fate of Ilya's preference was sealed. Had to keep a low profile from the Weasleys, of course. Because they wouldn't approve of such a hobby.    The summer was passing strangely enough, because for the first time in his life he had absolutely nothing to do. His animal friends, who had matured much faster than humans, had not yet recovered from the spring and had split up in pairs, and to be honest, they did not care about his two mates. The town had put up an APB on the boy and it had become really dangerous to show your face there. The music was still incomplete and it was getting very difficult to play for a long time. Only Percy, who had been dumped by Clearwater, or Danger, who was unlikely ever to be dumped because she was unlikely to go out with anyone, could play indefinitely without interruption. Except with a sixty-year-old librarian.    The only thing that saved me from boredom was the sneaking of cigarettes. What tricks did he devise to hide a pack of cigarettes and sneak a smoke? For instance, there was a small buoy in the center of the pond. If he baited it with charms and then pulled the fishing line, he could pull out a plastic bag containing a pack of "little soldiers of lung cancer". In a month and a half of smoking, Ilya managed to find his favorite company. They were magic cigarettes - Pirate's Dream. As you understand, the name alone conquered the young magician. The weasel did not know what was in them, but the smoke tasted like a piece of sea breeze, walking in the mouth and lungs, and exhaled was not a light gray smoke, but thick and white, as if a cloud was floating out of the mouth. So the name fully corresponded to the contents.    Another splash and a stone flew into the pond. Fish were not animals, so Ilya could afford not to like fish. Not like them alive, because Ilya appreciated well-cooked, seasoned fish. As did any other food, especially if it was free.    The boy exhaled noisily and tried to scratch the back of his head, but bumped into the bandana. Weasel still hadn't gotten rid of it, though he was already finally convinced that this bandage needed to be changed for something. Just a year ago the crown wink was stronger with the bandana, but this summer it was noticeable that it was on the contrary weakening with it. The young man had not yet figured out what to replace Jolly Roger with, but it was sure to be something interesting.   The sun peeked out from behind a cloud for a moment, and flashed its glittering ray directly into Ilya's ajar eye. The boy squeezed his eyes shut and crinkled a little, covering his face with his hand.    - I wish a miracle would happen," he sighed. - I was transported to Egypt.   The wind whistled, the grasses rustled, the ears were touched by distant laughter and screeching coming from the playing leafy crowns...   - We won the lottery! - there was a wild shout from the kitchen. - We're going to Egypt.   "Gazprom?" - The thought flashed through the mind of the young man, who jumped to his feet and scurried toward the surreal-looking house.             June 15, 1993 England "Nora"               Ilya was sitting on his trunk, playing with the lighter he had filled with petrol the day before. In the living room, there was an army training camp going on. Or rather, it would be, if the scale was added to the discipline. But as it was, everybody was rushing about, stumbling and bumping into each other, constantly discussing something, throwing things into their suitcases, wailing and anticipating the trip.    - Fred, did you put the toothpaste away? - Mrs. shouted as she went.   - I'm not Fred, I'm Percy," replied the tall nerd, who seemed instantly oblivious to the lady who had ditched him when he learned of his winnings.    - Don't forget to take Jeannie...   - Mama!" the girl interrupted her and, blushing, ran into the room.    - Guys, where's my screwdriver? - grumbled Mister.   - What do you need a screwdriver for, Dad? - George replied, shoving a stuffed animal into the trunk for some reason. - I'd rather have another magazine...   - Son!   Then Fred appeared, holding a huge plastic bag full of candy and chocolates and bubbles and whatnot. George, who had jumped up, immediately covered his brother, and, on the sly, he stowed this treasure of Pandora's in his trunk.    Weasel smiled, the Twins were willing to advertise their wares even to the penguins at one of the poles. Catchy fellows, they were sure to do well, and Ilya was sure that one day Hogwarts would not shudder at Zonko's trinkets, but at the pranks of the Weasleys. Ilya himself was as "on his toes" as always. He hadn't actually taken anything out of his trunk, always ready to move, so it took him about ten minutes to pack, too, whereas the others had been running around the house for about two hours.   And it all started with winning. I was going to have to get a subscription to The Prophet, and that was the paper that raffled off seven hundred Galleons to its subscribers every year. Which this year went to the Weasley family. And, you must agree, a hundred and forty thousand pounds, which is how much seven hundred gold coins in revaluation means, is not a small sum. The first thing the Weasleys did was purchase new school supplies for the children, including a wand and an owl for Ron. And then decided to put aside the remaining amount, well, and some part to spend on a long-awaited vacation. And not just anywhere, but to Egypt, the resort of Sharm el Sheikh, in the five-star hotel, just 15 miles from the bay of "Naam Bay". By the way the country was chosen very simply - that's where Bill works, so Mr. and Mrs. also decided to visit their son, whom they hadn't seen for a long time.   - Is everyone all packed? - the long-awaited phrase came out.   But don't think that after that the redheads stretched out in a string and moved towards the exit. Not at all. On the contrary. Everyone was feverishly going through their trunks to see if they had forgotten essentials. As a result the packing was delayed for half an hour until the long-awaited phrase was uttered.   - We're gonna be late for our flight!   The whole action was reminiscent of the Illyph Movie "Home Alone," except that the people weren't dragging the chests on themselves, but Mr. and Mrs. levitating them in front of everyone.    The people rushed out of the Nora to the highway, where they planned to hitch a ride with the Night Knight. Before he left, Mister waved his wand and the fence glowed silver for a moment, and a ghostly hood flickered over the house. But when Ilya turned around, he hadn't noticed it at all. Apparently magical shields had been planted, but that was of little concern to him now. After all, he was finally going on a well-deserved vacation to the sea.    Eight men, seven redheads and one in a bandanna, ran across the field to the highway. In the morning, and in the middle of nowhere, there were exactly as many cars as there should be under the circumstances-zero. Not a harsh klaxon chime, not a shuffling sound of old tires, not even a roar of new engines, none of it. Only the wind occasionally tossed the grass over the dark gray canvas. In such a backwater it was difficult even to get mail as postmen simply did not know that anyone lived near Ottery. And lived here, by the way, about five magical families, whose children, for some reason, did not go to each other. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of a nightmare, and I was in the middle of a nightmare.   The family stopped near the ditch, and Mister waved his wand. It was only a moment later, and the very sound of a klaxon screeching and the hiss of tires being washed out. Out of the void, as if from a fold of space, a double-decker bus suddenly slipped out. Unlike the last time, it was fairly clean, and the windows except for a gleam of mirror-like purity. Apparently wizards take care of machinery sometimes, too.   The door opened with a creak and the constant conductor came out into the light.   - You are greeted by the transport of wizards in distress, the Night Knight, are you in distress?             About half an hour later.            Ilya became more and more convinced that such things as flying powder, portals, and magical buses with hyperdrive under the hood were not for him. Ilya felt as if he'd decided to show off for the second time and drank a whole bottle of flamewhiskey again. Or rather, he felt the effects. The guy was nauseous and jittery after not the smallest trip from one part of the country, to another. And even though they had already entered the glass vault of Heathrow, the young man still couldn't come to his senses. What was depressing was that the other "travelers" looked pretty decent. Even Ronald was flashing his anticipatory smile and constantly fiddling with something in his jeans pocket... No, you guessed it, he just couldn't part with his new wand for a moment. And to anyone, willing or unwilling, he could go on for hours and hours about how he had chosen it, and what a core his battle buddy was. By some unknown miracle, or perhaps even by some higher power, Weasel avoided this reprimand and remained in blissful ignorance. Which allowed the young man to retain at least a touch of prudence and composure.   Wandering through the crowds of people, hearing all kinds of languages and voices, the eight finally came to the magic terminal. Yes, yes, the magic terminal. It was hidden from the eyes of ordinary people and was located in the distance, in fact at the very end of the border zone. It looked like a white box that would have held a dozen Hagrid men. Behind the desk stood an older clerk in a mauve robe and a classic bowler hat. Seated next to him was a young lad in a red cloak with an Auror coat of arms across his chest, a trainee or apprentice. Ilya grimaced; he didn't like pharaohs, and whether he had a cop's wand or not was a trifle more important.    And besides, didn't you think wizards traveled by means of international portals? Of course, if you've got the vestibular apparatus of an astronaut and a hundred galleons to spare, you can do that. But if you don't have one, you're better off with human air travel.    - Good afternoon," the old man nodded. - What can I do for you?   Auror drew his wand demonstratively-it must have been regulation, but it looked comical enough. It was like pointing a gun at eight armed men.    Mister stepped forward and calmly pulled out a leather pouch densely packed with gold coins.   - Eight tickets to Sharm el Sheikh.   The old man nodded, took out an old magic calculating machine and some shabby barn book. Ilya looked around and saw the operator briskly clicking his fingers on the keyboards and looking at the black screens of the monitors.   - Eight in business will triple you?   There was silence.   - What?" said Mister. - In the petrol?   - In business," Ilya sighed, rubbing his temples. - It means we'll get there in comfort.    Of course, Ilya was silent about the fact that business class tickets cost quite a lot. The flight to Ophira, the airport in Sheikh, was about five and a half hours, and during that time Ilya was going to enjoy the cinema and the comfort and not the whining of children and the snoring of adults.    Mister nodded, thinking, and made up his mind:   - Let's get down to business.   - That'll be forty galleons.    He untied the purse strings, drew out five coins, and placed the entire purse on the table. The five pennies went into the pocket of his tweed jacket, which did not match the blue-and-black jeans.    The old man counted the coins, nodded again, and beckoned the people with his hand. The family moved through the tangle of corridors, escalators, on which Mister kept trying to peek under the running skin. Until, at last, they reached the third floor, where a long, folding gut was waiting for them, leading straight to the doors of the Boeing. The stewards, who had met them at the entrance to the intestine, only when they saw the old man they became blind and did not notice the strange looking family.   Walking along the hinged aluminum, which vibrated faintly underfoot, Weasley and Ilya found themselves at the entrance to the plane. Inside, quiet and not-so-silent conversations, children's squeals, and other trappings of public transport could already be heard. The old man pulled a tin round from the folds of his robe and waved it in the face of a pretty stewardess in her twenties. You turned into a doll for a moment, and then smiled kindly, though her eyes were more like artificial dentures.    - Welcome aboard," the girl nodded. - Please follow me as I show you to your seats.   - Have a pleasant journey," the old man said goodbye and was off.   And the family followed the lady in a skirt so short and her legs so beautiful that Illyestal felt tight in his pants. He pulled himself back, though, and took a deep breath. Hormones were good, but he must remember that he had just seen a picture of wizards neglecting Muggles. He was tired of seeing wizards neglecting muggles. He had no interest in making a proper contract or a plane like the Night Knight, so he had to brainwash pretty girls. I wonder if this artifact in its action is very different from Imperio? Ilya had heard something about this spell, that it was one of the blackest, because it was sharpened solely on the subjugation, in fact - enslavement. Well, Ilya was in complete agreement with that interpretation, and anyone who wished to enslave another, Ilya was ready to test the strength of his belly in a collision with his butterfly.    But the stewardess had already led eight people to the very nose of the plane, where there were only twenty seats, which could safely be turned into beds. Ilya immediately took a seat on the far left, by the porthole. This was the first flight of the wizard of Scary Square and he didn't want to miss anything. The girl, meanwhile, gave everyone a smile and announced that departure was in a quarter of an hour.   The emotions on the mages' faces were very different. Mister seemed ready to take everything here apart, if he had the chance. Mrs. covered her eyes and moved her lips faintly, maybe praying? Though Ilya didn't know who wizards prayed to, certainly not to Merlin. Ronald went pale and huddled back in his chair, obviously scared. Jean was already asleep, because at night the whole house had the good fortune of hearing her scurrying about her room. The twins whispered conspiratorially, running their fingers over a map of Egypt. They were sure to have some adventure planned, and Weasel wouldn't mind joining it. As for Ilya, he was looking at the other people who had splurged on business class.   There were several "businessmen" here, who were actively whispering among themselves, looking at magazines, lists, some briefcases, and so on. There were also some young guys of an artificially scruffy appearance - the golden youth. All in all, business class was a rather amusing place, which Ilya hoped would serve hot chocolate.   Soon a stewardess came into the compartment, carrying an orange vest, the pre-flight briefing was beginning, which was successfully overlooked by Ilya. If they were going to fall, the last thing the wizard would think of would be the vest. Since the first thing that will come to his mind is whether, like Baron Menhausen, he can pull himself up by his hair. Only to use levitation charms instead of hands?   Exactly a quarter of an hour later, as if a surgeon were measuring in an operation, the pilot's voice sounded and the plane began to pull out onto the runway. There, beyond the little window called the porthole, the blurry silhouettes of buildings, trees, and various auxiliary machines floated by, all speeding up. Then Ilya popped a lollipop in his mouth and when the plane took off - the kid's ears did not stick up, which could not be said about the rest of Weasley. Yeah, sometimes it's good to read a lot.    The plane kept gaining altitude, and the young man stared spellbound at the approaching sky. Of course, once he had tried to reach the clouds in his Dror, but faster than that he had become dizzy and unimaginably cold. And here, the blue high was so close, he wanted to... After a few minutes, Ilya fell asleep as a baby. And no one would ever know what the wizard of Scary Square wanted.                        15 June 1993 Egypt, Sharm el-Sheikh airport   It would be a lie to say that Ilya slept through the entire flight, because he also managed to oversleep during the landing. How did he manage that? Oh, if the shelters can consume food in unlimited quantities, then they can sleep like soldiers - at every opportunity. But as soon as Illya left the cabin of the Boeing, having previously said goodbye to a lovely stewardess, he realized that he was in another part of the world. And it wasn't the airy airport building with its glass walls and bubble-like ceiling that told him that, but the sky. It was different, not at all like it was in Foggy Albion. Here it was much closer, brighter, warmer, and even a little bluer.   Ilya breathed in the air and felt the heat spreading over his body, streaming hotly through all his limbs, running into every corner, warming every cell. It was as if Ilya were thawing out from the winter and the cold. If Ilya had opened his eyes at that moment he would have seen how people who had left the plane were covered with sweat. He would have seen the Weasleys sweat and Ron reddened from the thirty-degree heat. But Ilya himself looked as fresh as if he'd just been showered. He even straightened his already straight back and squared his shoulders. Weasel seemed oblivious to the sweltering heat and the incredible heat. And if he did, he was clearly enjoying it.   - Stop meditating...   - ... Come on, hurry up...   - ... to catch up with the others.   The twins, pulling the Slytherin out of his sweet slumber in the sunlight, headed for their parents. Ilya, still stretching a rather boyishly silly smile, headed off after them. He kept breathing in the fragrant, hot air, feeling that he was reviving, though he could not say that he was not alive. Placing his face in the sun, drawing in the warmth and absorbing it like a sponge of water. Ilya, in just two minutes, managed to fall in love, no, no, not with the earth, but with this sun. It was so close, so real and alive, as if it were the embodiment of everything that Ilya appreciated so much.   He looked like a typical Arab from a bygone era. He looked like a typical Arab of centuries past. He had a black beard, like a bunch of grapes, eyelids lined with mascara, and white robes and sandals. The wizard stared at Ilya for a moment with eyes as black as a moonless night, as if thinking about something, and then he smiled at the adults with his snow-white, virtually Hollywood smile.   - I'm glad to welcome you in the land of the Pyramids and Pharaohs, - bowed slightly the Arab speaking in the purest English without any accent.   - It's a pleasure to be here," Mister said, a little confused, looking around. Mrs. was lecturing Ron with her handkerchief around her neck. - But I wasn't told we'd be met.   - Billy asked," the Arab shrugged. He turned halfway around and held out his hand, urging me to follow in the right direction. - He couldn't do it himself; a new pyramid had been found in the Valley of the Kings, and Bill and a team of destroyers were on their way.   Mister sighed a little disappointed, but nodded his head confidently. And at that moment Ilya, who just couldn't contain the urge, came in with his curiosity.   - Mr. Uh...   - Hotep," the wizard introduced himself. - Call me Hotep.   - Mr. Hotep, nice to meet you, I'm Ilya," he smiled. The Arab nodded. - I've always wondered, how do you hide your research from the Muggles? I mean, they've got cameras and satellites and Internet and all that.   - Magic, Ilya," Hotep smiled indulgently. - I'm not the only one who can use magic to make it rain over a field or iron his shoelaces.    - And no one's ever gotten close to your secrets?   A-Rab pondered, and he was listened to intently not only by the Slytherin, but by all the Weasleys who acted as tourists.   - There was a Mechur - that's what we call squibs. What's his name? Ind... Indo... Indiano...   - Indiana Jones?! - Ilya exclaimed.   - Indiana Douglas," the Arab snapped his fingers. - He was the prototype for the character. Well, he's been giving our Destroyers and Sentinels a hard time.   - And the Sentinels are the local Aurors?    - Exactly," Hotep nodded and turned the corner, followed by the others. - I'm not going too fast, am I? Your people get tired in our sunshine.   - Yes," the Weasleys exclaimed together.   - No!" shouted Ilya, who was literally on the rise.   The Arab looked at him with obvious curiosity, but the others looked at the boy like the apostles at Judas. Ilya only shrugged his shoulders and smiled modestly. The orphan was clearly in a good mood today and he just couldn't think of a turn in which that mood would be spoiled.   And just around the corner, there was an area on which there was a huge... carpet. And the most, so not pretentious, which you can buy in any antique shop for ten pounds. Tattered, faded in places, all disheveled and tangled fluffy strands. Ilya would not be Ilya if he did not know what was what. Immediately he realized he fully supported the Reform of Britain. This piece of cloth clearly aroused nothing but a healthy apprehension and unconcealed skepticism in Ilya.   - Please come aboard," the conductor, Arab, flashed his Hollywood smile.   The redheads instantly got up and sat down on the big carpet, with their chests in the center, which made sense in terms of aerodynamics. Hotep followed, but weaseled to the edge of the pile, hesitating to step forward.   - Maybe we could hitch a ride. - The young man put in a poke.   - Ilya, don't play dumb," the missus was clearly not happy. - It's perfectly safe.   Ararb gave a slightly condescending chuckle, and Ilyevse had to "come aboard". The prospect of this flight pleased him little, and his mood began to twitch dangerously. Apparently, there was still such a thing, which could spoil it. And it was called "magic carpet". No, who would have thought it.   - Tell that to the storm," he muttered, looking like a hurt... No, not a kitten anymore, but a young cat. He was soon to be fourteen, but he looked sixteen.   - We don't get storms here," Hotep hastened to correct the Englishman. Arab drew his somewhat crooked but beautifully patterned wand. The Southerner paused for a moment and then touched the carpet with the point of the nap. The carpet trembled and felt as if two magnets, unipolar to one another, had been joined together. The exact same feeling of resistance and repulsion, only several times stronger. Soon the ground began to recede, and the Slytherin's eyes widened more and more.   - Only sandstorms," the Arab finished.   - Pussy...   - Ilya!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. together, and Ilya never got a chance to finish.                Some time later.           Ilya fell to the ground and tried to wrap his arms around it. It didn't work very well, because the ground, compared to the young man, was very, very big. But at least the boy tried. Those thirty minutes of flight were like a personal Goat-Nostra for the wizard. Except instead of a wild race and a gunfight, he was invited to "just" sit on a swaying cloud, where every gust of wind felt like a spirit of death, hungry for fresh flesh.    - Never... never... sit... on that... machine.   - We still have to ride it back," Fred patted his shoulder as he passed.   Ilya exhaled dolefully and got to his feet. Well, at least he wasn't as twitchy and broken by the blazing disk of fire in the sky. Or at least it doesn't break at all, unlike the redheads, who are already breaking a sweat.    After ten minutes of leisurely walking along the paved path among the palm trees, Ilya felt a strange aroma. It was a light scent of something slightly salty, but also very fresh and inviting. The wizard closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he was filled with a feeling of increasing freedom, joy, but at the same time also anxiety. One half of Ilya had always loved water, but the other half was not so much afraid of it, but confidently wary of it.   No one had time to understand anything before the young man climbed the road up the hill, and there he whistled. Directly in front of him was a once sandy plateau, now an ennobled place with a tall hotel complex, rows of pools and low buildings, and there, beyond the golden line of the beach, across which hundreds and hundreds of silhouettes wandered, stretched an endless blue mirror, reflecting an endlessly blue sky. It was the sea. Ilya was for a moment confused by the duality of his own sensations, but then the young man saw three girls. The ladies swayed their hips in rhythm with the transparent fabrics of their pareos, which exposed the delicate lines of their bikinis. At one point the sun's rays welled up, revealing an even, bronzed tan. Her breasts, barely concealed by the fabric of her swimsuit, and her thin, graceful necks flashed. And that hair, like spilled black, strong coffee spilling over a sheet of paper. The girls noticed the young man and smiled. They were about seventeen years old, nineteen at most. One, the funniest or boldest, waved, smiled languidly, and stuck out a little shapely leg. Ilya swallowed. Girls laughed and, except that, winked synchronously, went on. One, the same one, turned around a couple of times. Ilya was glad that today he wore a long shirt on top of a T-shirt, the left side of which so successfully covered the tightness of his pants. Otherwise it could have been a very unpleasant mishap.   - How did you...   - ... is that what you're doing?   Ilya turned his head, and noticed that while Mr. and Mrs. were chatting with the Arab about something, Percy was reading the guidebook, Ron was staring frankly, almost animalistic to the point of nausea, at the sunbathing topless, Jean was daydreaming about something, the Twins were witnessing a small scene.   - Natural magnetism," Ilya grinned piratically, cocking his chin haughtily.   - My dear Dread.   - Yes, my dear Forge?   - Is it just me, or is that little cord poking fun at us?   - Anything can happen in a moonlit world...   Ilya was not the least bit vulnerable, but straightened his back. He was only half a head shorter than the taller Twins. The redheads got the hint.   - Or maybe...   - ... and he's not messing around.   There was a pretended, sympathetic sob coming from Fred's side.   - Is our...   - ... little Ilya...   - ... old enough to be a hussar?   Ilya only shook his head and pretended not to hear the question "below the buckle. After the flight on the magic carpet, Weasel had a persistent feeling that the ground was about to disappear from under his feet and he would topple down into the abyss of failure. What kind of evil genius invents such torture implements as the Night Knight bus, portals, a fireplace net, and the pinnacle of evilness, the magic carpet? Is there really an order of psychotic inventors somewhere, though still - unlikely.   - Shall we go? - A slightly strained smile came over the flushed Mister's face.   The twins threw one last look at Ilya, full of friendly banter, and followed their parent. Ilya looked once more at the beach, shuddered involuntarily at the sight of the water, and then hurried towards the hotel.   Ka-arim Naam Hotel, only recently built, has already become a mecca of sorts for Sheikhs. In this spacious building, resembling a dormant python, wriggling among the rocks, stayed a variety of personalities. Here were both economy rooms for those who can not afford the full service of five stars, and so ardently favorite Russian - All-Inclusive, and a variety of suites, for connoisseurs of rest with increased comfort.    But most importantly, there was a whole wing for mages and other sentient beings who had magical blood in them. Don't be surprised if you encountered a werewolf on the beach, a goblin under a warding amulet, some bizarre half-breed. At night, however, you with a hundred percent probability bump into a group of drunken vampires, who for some reason every time are fighting with the Russian on the subject - who from which floor to jump into the pool, who is with what speed drains mini-bar, who is faster to get in the face, stick to another's lady. In general, fangs were so overlapped, that only northern gentlemen with growling accent could find common language with them. But there were plenty of wizards themselves, too, and from all sorts of countries. Thus, Ka-arim Naam, in just three years, had become the recreation center of the entire Wizarding World.    At the front entrance of the hotel, where there were valets and a couple of doormen, another Arab approached the group of tourists. He was dressed like an Arab, but he had an Indian appearance. He wanted to raise his left hand and shout, "Hao, Chief.   The Arab and the Indian exchanged a few words, and the Chief ended the quick dialogue with a slight nod of his head. He turned to the waiting wizards, who were still levitating the chests in front of them. By the way, the usual people passing by were not paying any attention to this fact. Ilya, who looked up Percy in his guidebook, already knew that it was thanks to a whole complex of several hundred powerful amulets around the perimeter of the complex. The purpose of these things was quite simple: to ward off magic.    - This concludes our farewells," bowed the conductor. - Billy will be back in a couple of days, and he will be glad to see you. And this is Sir Abi Bai. He'll be your handler for the rest of your stay. I hope you enjoy our country.   - Thank you very much," Mister nodded and shook hands warmly with the slightly perplexed Hotep.    - Very grateful," Mrs. smiled.    The Arab nodded, replied with a smile of gratitude from the younger generation, and then turned and hurried off in the opposite direction. In the direction where the infernal carpet was... The mere thought of this madness, made Ilya's insides make a marathon run through every corner of his sprouted body.    - Welcome to the Ka-arim Naam Hotel," said the chief. - The rest will follow later, but now let us go inside, nearer the air-conditioners.    - Revolutionaries? - in his usual manner, Mister interrogated.   But the Indian was not at all confused, evidently he was used to it. The chief just shook his head and smiled, again with a Hollywood smile. Maybe it was their custom here, or they knew some charms?   - That's the kind of... you say "muggles" in England, don't you? Yes? Good. Then they're these Muggle gadgets that control the temperature of the air perfectly...   - Amazing," Mister exhaled. - And how...   Ilya skipped further discussion of technical progress, so he turned his head to the full three hundred and sixty. He was interested in literally everything in sight. The group of nine climbed the marble steps and found themselves in front of revolving doors, which, not surprisingly, managed to confuse the most brilliant wizard of a generation - Ronald Weasley. The Indian, it seemed, was an experienced wizard, and he bailed the unrecognized prodigy out of the wizardry.   The hall was strikingly spacious. Despite the fact that on the right-hand side, as was customary. There was a long reception with as many as five receptionists, so there was also a small bar with nine high chairs, six tables, surrounded each by three comfortable armchairs upholstered in white leather. Farther up was the staircase leading to the first floor, a staircase which would not yield to the finest museums of Europe in the splendour of its marble. And at each side of it there were escalators, carrying people up and down silently. Farther along, in a small tunnel, one could hear the clinking of lift doors opening and the good wishes of the doormen inside them. And a little further on, there were two doors, it led to the arcade, which rattled with the sound of billiards, slot machines, and even table tennis. The second, now closed, led to a real bar that was open after eleven and worked all night, and if Ilya was not mistaken, then in this bar you could also eat, and the second exit that led directly to the pool. Speaking of pools - despite the proximity to the sea, there were about a dozen on the territory, and one, central - was the largest and every day gathered a hundred other vacationers.   All in all, the Ka-arim Naam hotel complex could accommodate up to a thousand (or slightly more) people and non-humans. A truly stunning place, stunning not only for its size, but also for the wild atmosphere of a real holiday and resort. Ilya turned to the mirror and looked pityingly at the bandanna. No - it did not fit into the renewed reality in any way and required urgent replacement.    - Now, we are at the front desk, and if my amulet is averted from us now, you will have to count on your discretion from now on," the Chief began his lecture as everyone settled into their chairs. Ilya used all his will and restraint not to constantly stare at the ladies who were glistening with naked skin. Hormones are sometimes a very unpleasant thing. - In all, there were six werewolves, twelve goblins, twenty-three vampires, about a hundred of various half-breeds, and about two hundred wizards at the moment. All are broken into groups and have their own handler, I am yours. My task will be to arrange an unforgettable holiday for you and to keep you safe from anything that might happen due to close contact with Muggles.    Then Mrs., like a schoolgirl, raised her hand.   - Yes, Mrs. Weasley.   - Did you say vampires and werewolves?   - Oh," the curator waved his hands. - Don't worry, this has been a tradition in our hotel since its inception. And not once, I remark, not even once, has there been the slightest incident involving other races. Ka-arim Naam guarantees not only an affordable stay, but also the highest level of security. Does that answer your question?   - Quite," Mrs. nodded, but it was obvious that she was still concerned.    - Then I'll continue. All members of the Wizarding World have rooms on the seventh floor - only suites above that, so occasionally, but also on your floor, you will run into Muggles. Any incident with detecting magic, and amulets won't be able to handle the blatant display, the hotel staff will immediately smooth the situation over. But the culprit will be charged a fine, and not a small one at that. So please keep your wand in your pockets. There are certain zones for witchcraft, and I'll show you them later. There are practically no Muggles in those areas-except for the hotel staff.    This is where Percy raised his hand.   - Yeah?   - You said there were knowledgeable Muggles on the staff? - The nerd seemed surprised beyond belief.   - Of course. And there are only about seventeen mages on the staff, which is less than a dozen percent of the hotel's total workforce.    - It's...   - Very progressive," said Ilya, who spoke for the first time.   - Thank you," the chief nodded. - Also, in Britain and most of Europe they use flying powder, but our climate is too dangerous and that powder can simply explode. So tonight I'll take you to an area with fixed portals. The main one leads to our Magic City, Memphis. It's home to about 200,000 mages from all over Africa. Unlike the rest of the continent, it was easier for us to hide a single city from the Muggles than to integrate the magical districts into the capitals.    Ilya whistled mentally. Beans had mentioned Memphis in his History of Magic classes, but the numbers on the parchment and the proximity to the center of Southern Continent magic were different. An entire magical city is not the magical village of Hogsmeade with just over a hundred inhabitants. Only American New Salem could rival Memphis in its "epicness". No wonder Bill came here. Egypt is a kind of Old World magician's paradise.    - But the most dangerous places," Abi Bai didn't think to finish his introductory lecture. - Of course, these are our restaurants, bar, recreation area, swimming pool and beach. I would like to warn you right away that the protection of the hotel applies only to the hotel territory. If you happen to get into town, you'll have to deal with the Wardens yourself - but that's beside the point. Let's continue. It's not highly recommended that you bring your wand with you to all the places where Muggles congregate. But this advice is being heeded... ......is being heeded. So be as careful as you can. The fines are expensive, so you don't want to take any unnecessary risks. Anyway, that concludes the safety briefing, so let me show you your plates.   The people rose from their seats, and headed for the elevators, led by the newfangled curator, an equally newfangled group of tourists. But Mister held up Ilya and, strangely enough, Ron.   - Gentlemen, I have some serious news for you," Arthur Weasley said sternly. Ilya tensed, sensing that there was going to be thunder. But he had already guessed what this was all about, and he had even tried his ardent temper, which was ready to wring someone's neck. - You'll have to share a room for a month.   - What?!" Ronald roared.   And Ilya realized that Red had not yet grasped zen and higher enlightenment. In which you only start squeezing an imaginary neighbor, not a real one. However, seeing girls in pareos would redeem even cohabitation with Potter or Percy. Zen helped Illyana go for the wet. The holiday was beginning quite normally...       Chapter 21   August 1, 1993 Egypt, Ka-arim Naam beach       For two weeks now, Ilya had been doing what he was supposed to be doing - lying on the beach. With all his textbooks, notebooks, scrolls, quill, and magic counting machine tucked away as far away as possible, he was relaxing to the fullest. His schedule was simple and uncomplicated. In the morning, at nine o'clock, Ilya went to the local gym, where every odd day he spent a hard workout, and every even day just a light workout. After that, after taking a shower, Ilya would go to the buffet, where he would fill up his belly.   Having lounged a little in the room after a hearty breakfast, Ilya went to the beach, where he basked in the sun until noon. At this time, even the most hard-working people were dumped from the shoreline, as the sun at the zenith scorched mercilessly. And it was at this time, Ilya went to the sea, as there was almost no one else there and it was possible to swim without fear of bumping into anyone.   After an hour's swim, Pronyra managed to make it to the hotel, where a nearly finished lunch was waiting for him. Here Ilya would again fill up his belly, and then go to lie down again.   He was walking to the pool at about two o'clock, where he stared stupidly at the fairer sex. And the dark glasses, which hid the direction of his gaze, helped him in matters of secrecy. The pleasure of aesthetic beauty lasted for about an hour, and by three Ilya was again on the beach.   There he rented an umbrella, got an iced fruit juice, and lay down on a plastic hammock, continuing his baths, laced with cool shade. This was how Ilya spent all the time until evening - that is, until seven o'clock. Then dinner, a shower, and a short nap followed, after which Ilya changed his clothes and went to the club.   The club was a hotel club and was located on the grounds, but there was a catch: you had to be sixteen to get in, but we remember that weasel only looked his age. It was here that all the cunning of the boy became apparent. In two weeks he tried exactly thirteen ways, the most difficult of which was to get through the window in the closet, which was narrower than the boy's by about half. But how could an ordinary window compete with an experienced ventriloquist?   In the club the young man had once bumped into the Twins, but they were so good that they didn't notice the Slytherin, after that Ilya became more cautious. At the club, the young man usually just mindlessly partied, sometimes feeling other women's lips on his lips, and under his shirt, other women's hands. But beyond the hot embrace and lingering kisses it did not come, which, however, did not disappoint Weasel. These two weeks seemed to the former orphan a piece of personal paradise, a reward for all the troubles he had endured over the past two years. A true respite from everything that was in any way related to magic, and even worse, to the Golden Trio and their secrets, intrigues, and investigations.   The cohabitation with Ronald added a special color to his life. Ilya had never seen such untidy people. At their shelter, things that weren't in their personal nightstand or on a shelf in the closet belonged to the whole shelter, and therefore anyone could take them, so the rooms were always tidy. Ron, on the other hand, scattered things wherever they could go. When they reached Ilya's half, he burned them with a wave of his wand. Ron was almost furious the first time he'd done this and threw himself on his fists. Literally, because no sooner had he gotten into a clash with Ilya than he was already lying there, grabbing air with his mouth and pressing his hands to his stomach. Ilya, who usually punches right in the face, this time decided not to leave any marks - to avoid so to speak.   That wasn't the end of the misadventures. Ronald went on to his sordid ways, which had been a nerve-racking experience for Ilya, but everything the redhead was capable of was easily remedied with household charms. After this stage, the longhaired man began to use foul language, but the line was not crossed, so that weasel simply let his phrases pass his ears. When that didn't work either, the Gryffindorian decided to set his neighbor up. It was a very nasty and dirty story, which resulted in Ronald for two days hiding in his room, as the entire hotel has witnessed how a young, sixteen-year old girl slapped Redhead, covered his most sharp curse, and finally called the young pervert. But, as they say - do not dig another hole, because to set up Ilya, you have to be either Ilya, or ... Well, that's not even a fantasy.   Ilya rolled over from his stomach to his back and put on his dark glasses - classic, stylized American pilots' goggles. Throwing his hands behind his head, Weasel sighed a little sadly. Today was the end of an impeccably easy vacation, and the beginning of a vacation under the watchful gaze of Mr. and Mrs. It was from the first of August, when the first half was left behind, that a wide variety of excursions were planned. Today, for example, an excursion to Memphis, the day after tomorrow, the pyramids of Giza, two more days later, the Valley of the Kings, then to the Memphis School of Shamanism. Sort of like Hogwarts, only for Arabs and Negroes. So while Hogwarts is ranked number one in the world, Memphis is number fourteen. Not even in the top ten. Let alone in the top six. Not top six, not top five, not top seven, but top six. What was the reason for that? Well, Ilya knew it, but the time for such "secrets" had not yet come. However, according to the rumors, which came to the sensitive ear of the former bandit, and the signs that he observed, the time of this mystery will come in a year, maximum two, but that's another story.   - Regardez ce qui est un beau mec," came a maiden whisper, mingled with a languid chuckle.   - Si beau," the other one stretched out, also giggling.   Ilya opened his eyes and, without turning his head, looked away. Literally a couple of hammocks away from him lay two girls of blooming age. They were eighteen at the most. They weren't beautiful, but they were sweet and feminine in a way you could tell they were French. But okay, let's not lie, it was just that weasel didn't know much of the language, but even that was enough to identify the neighbors across the Channel.   - Dame," Ilya smiled at them, raising his glasses slightly, as if saluting with them.   The girls smiled and giggled again, their eyes glittering desperately. One was an obvious brunette, with beautiful, moisture glistening skin. And the other was a blond, with neat breasts that drew Ilya's gaze no more faintly than a free dinner. Ilya directed his gaze a little lower and literally drove over their long, slender legs. He had to swallow. Weasel was happy he'd figured out to buy swim shorts, which had their own advantages over swim trunks. Advantages that every young male body would appreciate.   The mousy girl threw a quick glance at Ilya and arched a little, and the young man immediately took the hint and began to rise from the hammock. Of course, he knew as little French as possible, but he might not have to speak, and the language barrier was simply not important when the languages themselves were in close contact.   - Yo, Ilya, are we...   - ... looking for you!   The girls looked regretfully at Ilya and turned away, still giggling. Ilya sighed sullenly and was about to slap his hand across his face, but remembered that he was wearing glasses. He turned and saw the Twins, who were dressed like chessboards. That is, Fred was wearing a yellow tank top and white shorts. And George was wearing a white tank top and yellow shorts. And the brothers had this expression on their faces, as if they were about to blow something up, set fire to it, poison someone, or something worse. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.   - You guys are unbelievable bummers," Ilya muttered.   - Or maybe...   - ... we're jealous.   - Yeah, well... You got Johnson and Spinnet.   - So in England...   - ... or in Egypt.   Ilya smiled slightly predatory, pirate-like, and poked Fred in the shoulder.   - I'll tell them.   The twins froze with their mouths open, then took Ilya into the box.   - We owe a batch of enhanced...   - ... dung bombs.   - And vomit bars," Ilya added.   - They're still in development," George shook his head.   - Against Malfoy and Co," the Slytherin shrugged. - Deal?   - I'm sorry," Fred nodded, "but I don't know what to do for the girls I love. - I'm going to have to do something for the girls I love..." He nodded.   - I don't know what not to do for them, but what you should do is keep your mouth shut," grinned Ilya, who was already contemplating how to use the occasional acquisition of exclusives from the Twins themselves. Perhaps the future third year snakes will have some very fun and entertaining days. - So why did you seek me out and end up screwing me over with the French girls?   - So these are French girls," Dread stretched out, glancing over Ilya's shoulder with a little smile. The ladies were apparently still staring at the statuesque brunette.   - The excursion's in half an hour, we should start packing," Forge explained, jabbing his brother under the rib with his elbow.   - I see," Ilya sighed a little sadly, and then suddenly he looked up and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. - Do you want to see something?   - Go ahead," the Twins replied together.   The brunette turned around and actually caught the girls' caressing glances. Ilya took off his glasses and winked with his trademark wink.   - Aurevoir," Ilya said in a sort of mesmerizing, velvety voice.   The ladies suddenly blushed, opened their eyes, and began to breathe rapidly, with their mouths slightly open. Ilya grinned, put the glasses back and walked to the hotel. The twins, whistling, hurried after, soon catching up with the Slytherin.   Half an hour later, the hotel lobby            Everyone had gathered in the hall except Percy. The botanist, as usual, had not finished his paper, or perhaps not finished his report, and now everyone had to wait for him. Ilya, on the other hand, leaned against the wall, folded his arms across his chest and covered his eyes. Today Ilya was dressed as a tourist should. He wore thin, almost transparent breeches, a loose fitting shirt, but most importantly he wore thin socks and very light shoes. And that was very important.   The rest of the Weasleys were wearing their flip-flops, and only Abi was wearing his sneakers. The curator glanced at Ilya's shoes and nodded in approval. Shoes are very important during the long excursion. You try to wear sandals or flip-flops, and all in forty minutes, maximum in an hour, an entertaining journey through strange country and culture will turn to your own hell with devils, hungry for flesh. Of course, if you're a chump in the head, you can put socks under your sandals and then you'll be fine. But be prepared for every other person to look at you like you're sick, if not every first person. So lightweight sneakers and thin socks are the best choice.   Ilya hummed. Sometimes it was useful to be not a homeboy, but a street punk, knowing all about such seemingly trivial things. The most seasoned of the older shelter boys, could even make themselves "out of shit a candy bar". But this is the highest level of skill, which is not available to Illya for the reason that he bailed midway through and went to magic school.   Finally there was Percy, who wore, just so you think - right, sandals and... Merlin, black socks. Ilya only shook his head and pushed his spectacles down from his forehead to the bridge of his nose. He'd have to pretend somehow that he wasn't with this family. An embarrassment like walking in the same boat as a tightly shuttered nerd didn't add to his reputation one bit.   - Since everyone's here," even Abi Bai didn't seem very happy. But he's not a servile man. - Then let's go, we're late as it is.   Mr. and Mrs. were at the same level as the curator, and the others followed. Ilya, waiting for everyone to move forward, joined the redheaded procession at the tail end. The path of the eight dwarves, led by Chief Blackhoof... Well, the people were on their way to the shimmering scarlet wall, blocking the gut with elevators. It shimmered, of course, only to those who were not strangers to magic.   Bai, not even slowing his pace, approached the wall, and then passed through it as if through steam, leaving only a playful shadow behind him. Ilya quickly realized that this was High Magic, called Illusion. In general, High Magic is not about throwing stunners, here you need the ability and dexterity, and style, and strength, and brains, in short, it is not surprising that only one in ten and forty of magicians can master this branch of magic. For instance Dumbledore and McGonagall did, but Flitwick didn't - he lacked power. But even that was no indicator.   Once, on a recording of a wizard's viewer, poor, ancient, with interference and black bars, crackling and creaking, a respected professor was showing a recording of his quarterfinal bout for the title of World Duels Champion, as well as for the Golden Wand, the prize for the title. Despite all the epicness and enormity of those spells, which scattered the Ukrainian, who owns High Magic, he lost because Flitwick managed to blind him with ordinary sparks, which even a first-year student would release. And then, thanks to a hiccup shorter than a heartbeat, defeated him with water spells. After that video, Ilya finally relaxed and accepted the fact that David could defeat a dozen Goliaths in magic if he was good enough and smart enough. To be "good enough", you had to "only" train until bloody vomiting and hundredths of sweat, not sparing yourself or anything else. Well, to be smart, you just have to treat yourself without any self-centered praise. As you can see, Ilya has been successfully coping with both of these criteria for two years now. But the thing is, he didn't need the Golden Wand and the honor of the best duelist.   Music, that was what was most important to Ilya, the most intimate and desirable. And all the rest - all this training to the point of fainting and almost having a pulse - was just a habit. The habit of a shelter boy, accustomed to the fact that whoever was weakest would be "under" and whoever was strongest would be "over." And that not to be "under" is to gnaw at life with your teeth and tear until the fattest, juiciest and most nourishing piece remains in your mouth. The habits, even those that were not appropriate, and should not be appropriate for any child on Earth, were ingrained in the subcortex as if melted into a red-hot metal. But such is the harsh reality, not covered by parental wings. However, we have gone a little off topic.   The delegation passed the illusionary wall and stopped in front of a dozen booths lined up in a row. Ilya looked over Percy's shoulder and whistled again. Each one of those booths, similar to a telephone booth, had clearly been magically enlarged. There was no room for two people inside, but inside the booth there was room for a dozen or so, not the smallest of people.   Bai stood next to the one with the fancy long ligature of Arabic words on it, with the shapely number "9." The chief clicked the lever and the glass door folded down, imitating the bus door.   - Coming through.   Mr. and Mrs. were the first to enter, followed by the Gemini, who immediately began to study the shimmering platform on which they stood. Percy, as if to show that he knew everything about everything, also entered the seemingly tiny booth. Ginny barely flew in, and Ronald weaved through at a pace as if he had a friend's funeral to go to. Ilya wouldn't be Ilya if he didn't poke at the booth with the tip of his knife before he went inside. Healthy paranoia was better than an unhealthy, deadpan pallor.    The last to enter, of course, was Abi Bai, who was still looking at Percy with displeasure. And he was understandable, for you, too, would not be happy, sitting in an upscale restaurant, to see some ragamuffin sipping beer from a bottle. If rules were made to be broken, it was decency to remember that you were a human being, not a pig.   - I'm gonna ask you to hold your breath, we're going to Memphis.   - Ebnvrt," Ilya crossed himself and closed his eyes.   Ilya did not see Abi pull the switch, similar to the lever of the "One-armed bandit", but he felt a new feeling to him. If through a normal portal he was pushed through a narrow hole, now he was blown up, exploded into tiny particles, and then suddenly compressed to a micron state, gathering the particles into a superdense core, and then began to stretch and expand, to his usual size.   Ilya opened his eyes and immediately broke into a crouch, almost touching the masonry with his nose. The boy sucked in air frantically through his dilated nostrils, trying to keep the world spinning in a frantic dance. Nearby there was the sound of convulsive regurgitation and the rustling of a cardboard bag.   - I told you to hold your breath," the curator's voice echoed in the distance.   When the world came back to normal, Ilya looked around. They were standing in a small room that looked like a station sting, only a smaller copy of it. Nearby were quite normal looking adults, Gemini and Percy. Ron threw up, Ginny twisted just as much as Ilya did... Ilya immediately realized everything and looked at Dredd and Forge. George put his index finger to his lips and Fred made a familiar motion as if he were counting the money. Ilya nodded; he could probably bargain for canary fudge prototypes as well. And here's the kicker - the Twins, snack on them hypogrif, were quietly training their apparatus, so they, the accustomed, didn't twist. Mr. and Mrs., like Percy and Abi, had a knack for it, and they were quite kamilfo too. But those who were unfamiliar with interdimensional movement had a hard time.   It took about ten minutes for everyone to recover, and Ronald was also sent to the bathroom stall, apparently he wasn't the only one who didn't follow instructions. After Ronnie-boy rinsed his mouth and caught his breath, Abi led the tourists out. The door creaked open, the sun glared for a moment, and when Ilya opened his eyes, he caught his breath. But this time it wasn't the monstrous gust of the portal at all, it was the unimaginable surprise, amazement, and admiration.   Ilya stepped over the threshold, found himself on the platform, which stood in the center of the square, from which beams ran a long road, lost in the intricate web of alleys, dead ends and streets. Among the three and five story houses, magic itself was literally flying. There was a whirring sound of hypogriffs that served here instead of taxis, and which could be used for a few coins to get to the right part of the city.   The trumpeting of elephants was heard, as they scattered like expensive automobiles along the tracks allotted to them. Here and there spells were ringing, broomsticks and flying carpets were being thrashed in the air, and now and then a variety of stalls were heard howling. And the mages... There were more of them here than you'd ever see in Spoked Lane, or Hogwarts, or anywhere but New Salem.   There were toga-clad orthodox men who looked as if they had recently returned from the Athens Forum. And people who wore surreal-looking fantasy canvas robes and gowns, topping them off with lovely cloaks on elegant hairpins. In the rivers of wizards there were the usual robes of various hues, and of course there were those who gave their sympathies to the Muggle style. There were, at a guess, half the total number.   Ilya swallowed and could not even swear, so delighted and amazed at the same time. It was as if a moment ago he was still in an ordinary world, albeit tinged with magic, but just once his heart struck and Ilya stepped, no not into a fairy tale, but into one of his books, written by Muggle fantasy writers. If England and Hogwarts was a fairy tale, then this was real fantasy, with bloody battles, friendship until the last wheeze, with adventurers who were not even bloody and, of course, wizards whose battles echoed in the legends. Ilya touched the hilt of his bowstring and imagined for a moment that it was a heavy bastard, ready to soar in a burst of lightning lunge. And the wand, a carved oak staff whose end sparkles with a ball of fire, eager to pierce the lath armor and carry the soul of the enemy beyond the edge. And a guitar behind a back is certainly harmonious lute, of course, elven work with strings from dragon's veins and unicorn's hair. A lute that would produce the most amazing sound and perhaps even compose a ballad about a crazy feat. Ilya closed his eyes again and took in the air again with a full chest, the magic flowing into him like a forest scent, filling every cell of his body. It was an amazing sense of hidden kinship. It was like a traveler in the desert, siphoning water from a cactus drop by drop, then suddenly kneeling in an oasis full of cold, pure moisture.   - Do you like it? - The chieftain's mocking voice came next to my ear.   - I'm in the...   - Is everything all right? - Mister asked, silencing Ilya.   There was a discordant chorus of voices. Ilya turned around and raised an eyebrow slightly perplexed. The Weasleys seemed, if not frightened, then clearly shocked. And not in the most positive connotation of the word. On their faces there was a confusion and a reflection of bewilderment, like that of a small man in the face of the newly built Titanic, startling in its majesty, phantasmagoric and general splendor.   - It's all right," Bai suddenly waved his hands. - Tourists always feel uncomfortable in our city at first. There's a special atmosphere here, and when you're not used to it, it can be very pressuring.   The Weasleys nodded, expressing their complete agreement with the statement. The chieftain turned to Ilya, who was once again greedily devouring Memphis with his eyes, trying to blend into the terrain, to dissolve in the feeling that the revived letters of the books would now take him and plunge him into a fantastic adventure, not comparable to the childish fuss of the Golden Trio, when all the answers are in sight, and to solve problems, it is enough to show a minimum of skill and wit, when death does not even think to look in the right direction - no risk.   - Have you ever been to New Salem?   Ilya did not immediately realize that he was being addressed, but he distracted himself from his reverie.   - I don't know," Ilya shrugged.   - You don't know? - surprised the chief.   It was obvious that Mrs. wanted to cut off this dialogue, so as not to say something that they try not to mention, but Ilya's tongue was faster.   - I was dropped off at the orphanage when I was a year old, and I don't know where I lived before that. He was a bit of a muggle, but my parents were Muggles, so New Salem was very unlikely.   - Oh," Abi stretched out, a little embarrassed, and turned to the older Weasleys. - And you...   - We're guardians.   The Indian nodded to some thoughts of his own.   - That explains it," he said.   - Excuse me, explain what? - with a little challenge in his voice, Mister inquired.   - Your hair," Bai shrugged. - I wondered how, in a family of redheads, a brunette was born, and I was ready to chalk it up to the paradoxes of magic. But it turned out to be a little more mundane than that.   - Do you like paradoxes too? - Ilya suddenly became enthusiastic.   - Who doesn't love them? - Bai answered question after question.   - You want to know something?   - I'd love to hear some English bikes...   One flight of hypogriffs later.                It was a grand building. At first he thought the curator had led them into the shadow of an ancient Greek theater, where they were about to see one of the most famous tragedies, but no, it was not so. What Ilya saw was in no way in touch with the theater, despite the straight rows of colonnades, the painted bas-reliefs, strikingly vivid, as if they were ready to burst forth and descend from under the arches. A dome-shaped vault, which was what made the well-read lad doubtful.   As the people climbed the high steps leading up to the colonnade, our Scary Square wizard's group joined the flow. With every step. With each movement, the young man felt himself enveloped in the milestones of history, a table of antiquity that its roots could not even be found in the song lyrics of the first peoples of the Interscore.   A river of people passed through the tall doors of the marble. Hanging from heavy, massive steel brackets, glowing with the Elder Runes, the mere sight of which made me lightly dizzy.   When he got to the inner hall, he realized that it was actually a museum, and not a theater. Despite the traffic, Abi took Weasley and Ilya aside, where they waited for who knows what, but rather who.   And soon that someone showed himself. As Ilya reasonably suggested - their guide appeared. A youthful lady with arched eyebrows, a sharp but pretty chin. Okay figure, but wrinkled neck and arms. The lady was in her forties, maybe even forty-five.   - Welcome to the Library of Alexandria," the white-toothed woman gleamed.   Ilya's eyes almost popped out of his mouth. Only the most hopelessly gray and stupid had not heard of the lost or burned (according to the Muggles) library, which housed the most ancient manuscripts, chronicles and chronicles. It was even rumored to contain descriptions of Ancient Magic - unwieldy, immensely clumsy, no longer useful to anyone, but still fascinating to connoisseurs.   - The Library of Alexandria? What is it? - Ron asked.   Ilya took a step to the side, demonstrating that he was not at odds with this baboon, but simply forced to be present nearby.   - It's my job to tell you," said the woman with a slightly strained smile, her eyes tinged with the contempt a book-lover feels for someone who has only read his ABCs in life, and not all of them.   And the journey through streams of legends, waterfalls of bylinas, swirling ballads, rains of songs, and whole centuries of history began. A journey during which Ilya was afraid to breathe so as not to drown out the Arabian's story, afraid to "think too loudly" so as not to frighten the unfolding imagination, afraid even of his heartbeat, so loud and abrupt that it seemed about to shatter the atmosphere and scatter its shards to the remotest corners.   Ilya was like a monkey hypnotized by a python, and Weasel could not even bring himself to hate the yawning Ron at that moment. Who was demonstrating his contempt for excursions in general and the revived legend in particular with his whole appearance. If Ilya had not been under the spell of the Arab, he would have taken great pleasure in ramming his fist into Ronnie-boy's face to wipe that sneer off his face. Ilya still had no patience for bulls, and the redhead was now the epitome of grayness, stupidity, laziness, and bullishness. What a shame in front of the southern wizards, for such a disgrace to Britain... But the tour continued.   Ilya saw the wizarding scrolls, the Muggle clayboards, listened to the stories and tales, and still could not believe that all this was happening to him - to an ordinary, unremarkable boy from St. Frederic's Orphanage. There must have been some confusion up there in the clouds if the lucky ticket for zero merit had fallen into the hands of an underage gangster. Well, I can't complain.   One excursion and hundreds of reveries later           Three hours of the tour flew by like the flick of a second hand falling from the vertical to the horizon, and Ilya realized that he had fallen in love with it. He fell in love with what was called a "tour", yes, it was only his first visit to such an institution as a museum - but the young man realized once and for all that when visiting a new country or city (and the King of Rock is obliged to tour) Ilya would definitely visit as many exhibitions and museums as possible. I had an impression. That someone had lifted the Weasel out of the bottle of Anglican culture and suddenly submerged him in another culture, dipping him with his head, wrapping him like a bean in a burrito. It was amazing - to lift the veil on something new, unknown, so alien, but so damn interesting. Ilya even allowed himself to be subdued for being frustrated that the time of idle wallowing on the beach had passed. After all, you can roll around at any time, and an adventure like this is worth a lot.   - What do you think of the tour? - Abi grinned as he waited at the exit. The tour guide was standing next to him as well.   - Very enlightening," nodded Mr. and Mrs., who were clearly tired.   The twins, Ronald and Ginny just smiled wryly, clearly not interested. Percy was about to open his mouth, but...   - It's amazing! - exclaimed Ilya. - It's like a time machine. And the scrolls of Imhotep? Or works of Hippocrates, who would have thought that he was the best teacher, being an ordinary man! And the diaries of Alexander the Great, because he defeated the Dark Lord, although he was holding an ordinary sword, and his blood did not run through his veins! And the first invention of a mechanical artifact? And it in the fifth century A.D.! And the records of the contemporaries of those or other epochs. Who would have thought that fauns were real creatures? So were nymphs! Even in the most ancient annals they are mentioned only casually! And how much here and in what language, Alexander collected not just a Library, but he opened the whole world of books!   Despite the fact that Ilya was literally choking on words, despite his excitement (it is amazing how it did not come to censorship) the guide at every exclamation, at every gesture expressing an extreme degree of admiration, more and more bloomed. For her, such expression was the best praise and compliment at the same time.   - I'm very glad you liked it," the Arab woman smiled.   - I'm... I'm... I'm in complete awe... delighted," Ilya corrected quickly.   The guide smiled again, and Abay called the adults over, they had something to discuss together with the Arab woman. Apparently to make further schedule or something. Ilya was looking in the mirror all the time and understood that bandana didn't suit this museum. It was as untidy, as unkempt as the socked sandals on Percy's feet. It was as if, for a moment, Ilya had stooped to being a boor named Ronald.   "Goodbye, Roger," the young man thought, and pulled the bandage off, spreading his wavy, tar-black hair over his head. So black, in fact, that at night you couldn't even see it.   - Maybe you should marry Granger," Ronald whispered with a hint of sarcasm. - The two nerds make a great couple.   Ilya turned and looked at the smug jerk, who was over the moon. After all, in his (Ron's) opinion, he had so successfully jabbed the rotten slug. It was pathetic. No less pathetic than Malfoy's defile and his perpetual brushing of his coiffed hair. The two were a pair, banal and uninteresting individuals, unable to see beyond their complexes and unreasonably inflated egos.   - You know, Griff, if any lady falls in love with you, she'll do it purely out of pity," Ilya scoffed, but Ron was too engrossed in mentally praising himself to take a few seconds to think about how he'd been humiliated. And Ilya already had his pirate grin blossoming, which was not lost on him in his pirating, even in his lack of bananas. - But if you marry Granger, my word, she'll cheat on you with me.   - Yeah, I need those girls.   And with a look of absolute dignity, Ron withdrew to his relatives. And Ilya realized that he had foolishly and fervently given his word. After all, if Ron married Granger, there was a possibility (albeit an infinitesimal one) that by that point Ilya would be married as well. And cheating on his wife - no, that's not the way of the wizard of Scary Square. However, it is useless and silly to worry about this right now; problems should be solved as they arise.   Ilya took one last look at the surviving building of the greatest of the Ancient Capitals. Who would have thought that mages had saved this mecca and moved it to their city. Not even Bince had told them about it, even though they'd been through antiquity since their freshman year. Amazing things sometimes lurk beneath the candlelight, waiting for you to deign to lean in and take a closer look.   And then Ilya's gaze suddenly stumbled. He suddenly discovered something he had never thought he would find here. There, at the entrance to the halls, was a group of other sightseers who were just preparing to dive into the sea of legends. And there, standing among them, was a girl. She looked sixteen years old, but Ilya somehow sensed that she, like him, fourteen, maybe a little less. Not that the lady was beautiful, rather sweet and pretty, but incredibly feminine. Put one of these in line with the first beauties, and the eye would still look for that bronzed skin, black, searing hair, and bright brown eyes all by itself. That chiseled nose, slim brows in a spread, high, carved cheekbones and sensual lips. Her gaze would glide over her sculpted figure, caressing her neat breasts, the smooth lines of her hips, and her long legs. No, she was not a beauty, but there was something about her that felt like a magnet pulling and beckoning, making her forgetful in her reveries. And Ilya waited, waited for their gazes to collide and he could wink at her, wink and throw off the fleeting obsession, pleased with the blush and the ragged rhythm of her breathing.   Here she is a little turned around, but...   - Izabel," a strange middle-aged man, dressed like an archaeologist from the early nineteenth century, called out to her. - Ir beleza, passeio come&ccedil;a.   - Sim, papai," said the lady, smiling and hurrying after the grey-haired man.   The group disappeared into the shadows of the hall. Ilya kept staring into the darkness of the gap, hoping to see a glimmer of brown eyes.   - Ilya, let's go," Mrs. called softly to him.   He stood for a moment, then waved and shrugged. He turned and hurried toward the redheads, who were on their way out. In half an hour he had no memory of the lady with the bronzed skin and brown eyes.   Some time later.           Ilya wandered around the Memphis shopping district, amazed at what you couldn't buy here. The only things you couldn't buy here were happiness, and, as all romantics would say, love, because everything else was sold here in full assortment. From ingredients for potions, to enriched uranium, from brooms, to personal jets, from cats, to griffins, for seven hundred galleons per cub, from strictly tails, to ball attire in the best Louis XIII receptions, from wands to magic swords made of ice or even flame. There were so many stalls and shops that you wouldn't have had an immortal life to visit them all and look at all the merchandise.   Thanks to Abay, free time had been set aside after the tour, and those who had received maps of the area had dispersed according to their preferences. Or rather, Percy and the Twins did, as Mr. and Mrs. Ron and Jean hesitated to let them go. How did Ilya "let go"? Well, he's Ilya, he'll always find a way.   However, Ilya was looking for something definite, namely, a replacement for his bandana, which had served him faithfully for almost two years. How many girls they had made blush or laugh together, how many times Salty-haired screwed up his telepathy, and in principle looked stylish. But the time of the robber pirate Ilya the Weasel was over, and it was time to tweak the image a bit.   Ilya wandered his gaze around the display cases, where not a single item stood still. Books were flying, and some even tried to bite the vendor, flasks and test tubes were ringing like an "angel piano" (p.a. who does not know - it is such a rack with crystal glasses filled with water held at different levels.), paintings were discussing something, busts were reciting pathos, and everything was moving, nothing was stopping.    - Here you are," smiled Ilya.   At last he had found what he was looking for. The young man stopped in front of a small shop, lost among its giant neighbors. There was a single display case, on which everything stood frozen in tainted jelly. Above the entrance, however, a mechanical figure of a gentleman was creaking, taking off his hat. His hand was trembling slightly (the mechanism was obviously unlubricated), so it seemed He seemed to want to bash his head in with the hat.   - "Hats from the Hatter," Ilya read.   The amazing thing was that the inscription was duplicated in twenty other languages. There were even some completely incomprehensible hieroglyphs.   Ilya, not the least bit embarrassed, went inside and was immediately puffed up by the cloth dust that had settled here and there. It was a small establishment, offering only men's hats, but a variety, from wide-brimmed hats with plumes to bowler hats and, importantly, fedoras. Here and there, on faceless mannequins, were the most bizarre and the most banal of garments, and there were even a few baseball caps that certainly did not fit in with the local entourage.   The weasel, twisting his head, walked over to the counter and struck a bell similar to the ones on hotel counters. There was a grunt, and an old man came into the light, looking a little like a rabbit for some reason, but that was probably a figment of his imagination.   - Englishman," said the salesman with a slight but incomprehensible accent.   - Yes, sir.   - Oh, I am so glad, so glad," the old man leaned over the counter and shook the hand of the bewildered Ilya frantically. - The last time the Englishman came to see me was when I had forgotten that he had come to see me. However, if he did come and I had forgotten, it does not mean that I did not find him a hat worthy of an English gentleman's head. You are a gentleman, aren't you? Why do I ask, though, you are an Englishman.   Ilya thought that even here most mages are a bit crazy, though this one is more of a "a lot" crazy.   - What do you prefer? - The salesman, who looked a bit like a rabbit, continued. - Baseball caps? Eight-pin caps? Cadet hats? Hats, as they say now - the rapper? Duck caps? Panama hats? Hats? Hats with a brim? Hats with earflaps, all the way from Siberia?! How about straw hats from Kentucky? Or hamburg hats? fedora hats? Or fedora hats?   Ilya, towards the end of the speech, realized that he was about to either run away or faint, as this stream of consciousness, bizarrely made his head spin, like after the best race on the Night Knight.   - Ah, why do I ask - of course fedoras," the salesman fired a warning shot. - I'll pick out the best one for you, in which your head will feel as if it were lying on the lap of your beloved wife. Just a moment, Mr. English gentleman.   The salesman slammed the hidden door and disappeared into the back of the store, leaving a perplexed Ilya to continue to be perplexed. The most surprising thing was that the old man returned in a couple of moments. At first it seemed to Ilya that he was holding a black drum, but then he realized that it was such a box.   The old man put it on the counter and with one light, but dexterous movement of his hand, pulled off the bow. With the bow the lid flew theatrically into the air, revealing to the world the contents of the box. There, at the bottom, lay a short-brimmed black fedora. It was so black that it could even compete in richness of color with Ilya's hair. And, uncharacteristic of felt hats, there was neither a cloth band nor a strap, of the same material as the hat, at its base, where the main part adjoined the brim.   - Please," the salesman smiled.   Ilya took the hat out carefully and immediately put it on his head. Something displeased him, and he moved it slightly over his eyes.   - Splendid! - The salesman exclaimed, holding out a mirror to the young man.   Ilya picked it up and... realized it was his. Yeah, it was just his. It was as if this hat and the guy himself were made for each other. Weasel put his thumb, index finger, and ring finger to the brim, then winked. Devil, he almost lost his own breath.   - I'll take it.   - Of course you do," the salesman nodded and simply threw the box into the corner. It was as if he knew that the black lady would never return to her dungeon. - Anything from the money will do.   - Anything?   - Well, I don't know what kind of currency you have. But honestly, I don't take souls.   Ilya rummaged in his pocket and pulled out a leather pouch containing galleons. There were ten in it, a quarter of the lad's entire capital; how much was he willing to shell out for such a miracle? Ilya rolled out the whole ten. The seller smiled and took only one coin.   - I'll tell you something," the salesman beckoned to the young man who had put the money away in his purse.   Ilya bent down and the old man whispered hotly in his ear.   - A lot of people like other people's minds, but this hat will keep you out of it.   - Is it lined with magic-insulating fabric?   - Who knows - who knows. Maybe she just fell in love with you and is ready to protect you.   Ilya still settled on the insulating cloth magic option, but that wasn't what he said in his ears.   - Thank you, sir...   - If you do not know my name you have not been paying attention, but that does not change the fact that my name is exactly as it ought to be for a hat seller. Good-bye, Mr. English gentleman; I will not sell you another hat, so it is unlikely that we shall meet again, and even if we do I shall not remember you, for I have already forgotten who you are.   Ilya left the store with a strong feeling that he had just talked to a real madman. A very entertaining madman, though, who sells the most amazing hats in the world. Ilya swiped at the margins of his new hat, realizing that he had only one thing left to do in this place.   And a little while later.           "Jinx's Tattoo Parlor" was where Ilya came in. He found himself in a bright room, resembling a small street barbershop. There were mirrors here, too, and armchairs on sliding legs, which stood next to racks filled with vials and other incomprehensible stuff. The only thing that smelled in the air here was not hair dye at all, but a completely different dye and a slightly ironic tinge of blood as well.   - Kid, are you even sixteen? - asked the girl of twenty-five, whose body was completely tattooed. Even her neck and eyelids and chalky designs. It was all very suggestive, but not at all appealing. But there was always a buyer for every commodity.   - What do you think? - Ilya winked.   - Well, then tell me why you're here.   - I went to the tattoo parlor for a beer.   - You got a sketch, humorist, or do I have to sit down for pencils?   Ilya took a paper square folded several times out of his pocket. Jinx snorted and took the sheet and unfolded it. She looked at it for a while, and then nodded.   - Simple, but with an idea. A musician?   - Yes," Ilya nodded.   He left his guitar in a special storage room in the building in front of the entrance to the shopping area. Apparently this was done in order not to make the salesmen nervous, but maybe there were other reasons, too.   - Well, take off your shirt and sit down.   Without a second's hesitation, Ilya threw his clothes on a hanger and sat down on a chair. With a wave of his wand, Jinx made the chair move, straighten up, and Ilya took a semi-reclining position.   - What color do you want?   - Let's do it in black.   - Black is a timeless classic," the tattoo artist snickered.   She picked up a can of paint, a stick of some kind, and a second "G" stick with teeth on the end. She dipped the prongs into the paint and held it to the boy's shoulder. She adjusted herself, put the prongs to her shoulder and swung the second stick. By design, the pattern was as follows. From the shoulder to the forearm, black lines ran, entangling in a spiral, and on the back of the forearm, closer to the wrist, they merged to form the most beautiful note that goes at the beginning of every major part. As a matter of fact, for many people it was the note that was the written designation of the music.   - This is going to hurt," Jinx warned me honestly. - Don't hold back the tears.   - I'm not a ba... I'm not a girl," Ilya said indignantly.   - Not the girl," the master nodded, still not making the first punch. - And the fool. I had such boars pouring in...   - Pfft," Ilya snorted.   And Jinxx, without warning, struck, there was a clang of the stick against the stick, and needles dug into his shoulder, getting paint under his skin. Ilya felt uncomfortable, but no more so than if he'd just been accidentally pricked. The girl leaned back and waited. She sat like that for about ten seconds.   - What, it really doesn't hurt? - she asked in surprise.   - No, it's just unpleasant.   - You've got a lot of respect, musician," the girl said and started tapping. She bit her tongue, biting down on it a little.   For a while there was only the measured clatter of wood and the occasional shuffling sound of gauze rubbing against leather.   - Look, why does it have to hurt?   - Are you in school?   - Yeah.   - Ever had a salamander lick?   - No," Ilya shook his head.   - Lucky," the lady chuckled. - I was licked, and it hurt like hell. I was in the middle of a tattoo, and the paint was based on salamander saliva, diluted with a lot of spells and other ingredients, but the salamander saliva was the main ingredient. It used to be all they used, pure, by the way. The pain was hellish, but the tattoo was powerful, blue and shimmering. The truth was, it turned out later, that such jewelry could easily be washed off with blood. So we started to think, but not the point. I was a little bit more careful when I was in the phase, and then I was in the phase.   - Then I'm lucky," Ilya smiled.   - You can't argue with that. Maybe you should do something else.   - Not yet, but...   - But if you're thinking about it, you come straight to me, I'll cut you up... all eyes will be on you.   - Done. By the way, I've always wondered how...   Four hours later.   - Not all of them," Jinx wrapped a bandage around my arm and secured it with a special band-aid. - Listen to me carefully, you...   - Do not scratch, do not keep in the sun, do not wet and rub, keep under a bandage for three to five days, and more often lubricate with a special ointment, which you are about to give me.   The girl looked at the guy, then smiled and flicked him on the nose.   - I'm not a Muggleman," she hissed playfully. - I'm not a muggle craftsman," she hissed jokingly. I'm not a Muggle craftsman," she hissed jokingly.   - Then what did you want? - surprised the young man.   - You shouldn't have interrupted," she snorted, stacking her chopsticks on the tray. - I'll tell you what, if you tell anyone that I beat you, I'll kill you.   - ?...   - You expect me to believe you're sixteen? Your body is dragging, your eyes are childish. So get lost, you juvenile delinquent pretending to be in charge.   All this was said without malice, so Ilya got up, left the coins, thanked, dressed, and went outside. There was a whisper in his back.   - If you're thinking about it, stop by!   - Okay," the Slytherin shouted back and hurried to the locker.   Today was a wonderful day that was surely coming to an end. Many would say a tattoo is a silly fad, but what King of Rock is without a tattoo? That's right, no one.    Chapter 22   3 August 1993 Egypt Giza           Ilya was especially looking forward to this day. And though he had only one day to reap, those twenty-four hours seemed to him something endless, the endless running of the second hand, the distinct march of the minute hand, and the dull crawling of the hour hand. The time dragged on so slowly that he wanted to stand up and cry out, "Hey, can you hurry up? There are people waiting here!". But the clock remained indifferent to the rest of the world and continued its measured and unhurried course.   Of course, the fact that the Weasleys had gone to a lot of verbal lengths in an endless stream of lectures to wash away the tattoo added to the color. The one who had been the most vocal was Mrs., who found the very thought of ink under the skin on her left arm to be something horrible, something akin to a crime. But the young man answered simply: he was a rocker, so he had to be, otherwise he was no fucking rocker, just another poser.   The fact that Ronald had managed to get jealous of that, too, did not add to the mood. In general, as far as Ilya was concerned, Ronnie was jealous of anything that he felt distinguished others from himself. In fact, this was not a weakness of character, but rather a syndrome of lack of attention and a little brother complex. But only in a very acute, even exacerbated form. Because the same syndrome was manifested in Ilya and all the wards of St. Frederick orphanage. The only thing was that Ilya was not jealous, but was in every possible way showing off his virtues, pedaling his eccentricity and extrovertedness.   But then today was finally here, and Ilya jumped to his feet, just as his alarm clock beeped. Earlier it had sounded like the ghastly giggle of a mad demon, but this time Ilya heard an angelic chant. Ilya, jumping up as if he had been electrocuted, flew into the bathroom, where he washed faster than the "spirit" that the "grandfather" was mocking.   For the first time in his life, Ilya's breakfast was limited to the standard portion and only one mug of hot chocolate, after which Prynora was already standing near the portals, flicking his lighter a little nervously.   It seemed to him that the Weasleys were pulling up so slowly, so lazily, as if they were even mocking and sarcastic. As if they were walking so slowly, yawning, rambling about how they could have napped for a few more hours, how the pyramids had stood for thousands of years, they could have stood a little longer. Only Mrs. was expressing any haste, but only because Bill had gotten out of the excavation in the Valley of the Kings today and had promised to give a tour of the pyramids.   At last Abi Bai appeared. He was a little sleepy, and on his neck, under the silk scarf tied in Arabian fashion, there was for a moment the edge of a red blotch. Apparently the smiles and glances he had thrown at the guide in the Library of Alexandria the night before had not been in vain, and the chief was in for a treat.   - Is everybody here? - asked the Indian on duty.   - Yes," answered the Mrs. and Mister for everyone.   - Then please.   The mere sight of the booth made Ilya sick to his stomach. But still, clenching his teeth in a steel lock, the young man took a step forward. And again that terrible feeling of splitting and then shrinking to a point.   He was not in a room at all this time, but out in the fresh air, which smoothed the situation out a bit. There was only sand and wind all around, and the sun, so close, stroked his skin, covered with an even layer of shiny tan. Weasel took a special handkerchief out of his pocket and tied it over his face, making it easier to breathe.   Bending down, Ilya tightened the laces so that they were tight but didn't chafe his shin, and then he secured the laces with special soaks. He put on light, fingerless gloves of synthetic leather that wouldn't bake on his hands. His hat was still on his head, so he had no problem with that. Abi once again looked with respect at the lad who had a clever approach to the seemingly simple matters of life.   - They'll meet us now," said the Indian, with a little yawn.   The Arabian woman had made him so sick... But the weasel was no longer busy discussing the charms of the young museum worker. There, ahead, they saw something that strikes people's imagination for almost four thousand years - the Giza Complex.   Three huge, surreal and incomprehensibly large pyramids, from such a distance, seeming monolithic, as if a huge child had molded them from a mold of wet sand. Only one look at the central, largest and majestic - the Pyramid of Khufu (in common parlance - Cheops), became uneasy. From a structure there was some mysterious power, unimaginable force and will of the people who have coped with such task. And the architects who designed the only Wonder of the World, which has passed through all the milestones of history up to our door.   Even the wise guardian of creation, the noseless sphinx, was not as magnificent in its antiquity as the final resting place of the soul of the wisest of Pharaohs, Khufu (as his body was not found there) and his queen. According to the Ancient Chronicles and Library records, Ilya knew that Khufu's grandson had refused the help of the Priests and their magic. Pharaoh wanted to prove to the world that existed then, and to the world that will exist afterwards, that magic was not a gift from the gods, not a fantastic power and horror of the soul, but a tool in the hands of man. A tool not much different from the woven ropes, logs and planks on which huge boulders were dragged with felt from the Nile. And it is certainly not more perfect than a chisel and a chisel, with which these rocks were worked at night for half a century, fitting them so tightly and perfectly to each other that even in our times it is sometimes difficult to stick a penknife's blade between them.   Thousands of people, not slaves but free men, considered it a great honour to work on the construction site. There was no whistling of whips, no scolding of overseers, only the great dream and the bloody path to it. Many gray individuals believe the pyramids to be slave labor, but they are simply uneducated and do not know that in Egypt, slaves were not allowed to do government work. Whether it was building a new canal, building irrigation systems, pyramids, or anything else, free people - citizens of the country who considered "public works" as an honor and duty - went to work for all this.   No these majestic ancient temples, the abodes of the dead were not a mute reproach to slavery, they were the embodiment of how the genius and dreams of common man surpassed all the power of the Priests and their magic. The six pyramids of Giza and the wise Sphinx have served for nearly four thousand years as a reminder to wizards and muggles alike that whether you have a wand in your hand or not, you are a common man, with the same blood as the one you so despise for what he cannot do, but overlook what he can.   - Bill," Mrs. exclaimed, enclosing another redheaded boy in her arms.   He was tall, a young man, with large shoulders and a truly bullneck. Bill Weasley was a tall young man, with broad shoulders and a truly bullneck. I could tell from him that either he was sleeping in the gym or that he was clearly not a sedentary person. Green eyes looked at everything with a clever sneer and a silent challenge, a man accustomed to live without looking back - to the fullest. One look at this figure, dressed as an archaeologist of the past, and you immediately realize that this adventurer, worthy of an Indiana Jones hat, is in front of you. And the red hair in a ponytail and the dragon's fang in his ear only reinforced that impression.   - Mom, it's good to see you, too," the older son smiled. - But you're about to strangle me.   - Oh, yes," Mrs. wiped away her tears with her handkerchief, and stepped back a little, continuing to stare at her offspring.   - Dad," Bill smiled and held out his paw to his father, who was a head and a half shorter than him.   - Son," Mister shook his hand and a silent dialogue passed between them for a couple of seconds.   - Small ones," Destroyer saluted jokingly.   Percy snorted inaudibly and turned away, Ron was embarrassed, the Twins began to glance over and wink at Bill, and Ginevra immediately rushed over to her brother and wrapped him in a mother-like embrace. Except that, because of her age, she hugged him around the waist, resting her head against his abs, even through the linen shirt.   - You're all grown up now," the man laughed and touched the girl's hair. The girl immediately fluffed up and puffed up like a mouse.   - Yo gorilla," Ilya waved his hand.   Bill glanced over the Slytherin's figure and grinned slightly.   - You'll be just like him," he said with a smirk. - And you, Ilya? I've heard about you.   - Everything that was said about me was a lie, everything that was said about me that was bad was pure truth.   - Ilya," the missus shouted. - Behave yourself.   Bill looked at the boy once more and then held out his hand. Ilya's palm almost sank into that grip, but he still squeezed the goblin bank worker's calloused palm with force. And the third oldest Weasley, in turn, squeezed Ilya's hand. They held on like that for a couple of seconds, then loosened their grip and broke the handshake altogether. Bill gleamed his eyes slightly, and gave a respectful chuckle. Ilya shrugged his shoulders, as if he knew ours.   - I'll leave you here," Abi Bai suddenly cut in on the family reunion scene. - Business, you know.   Everyone said goodbye, and Ilya allowed himself a smirk. He guessed about these things - if not another round of bedfights with an Arab woman, then a healthy sound sleep until late in the evening.   - Bill, what's that in your ear?! - Mrs. exclaimed.   - Well, ma'am," the tall man said in a childish way.   Everyone laughed, cheerfully and carefree - in a family way, and so unfamiliar to Ilya, who did not distinguish this laughter from another. Though Ilya did not think about it now, he was more and more attracted to the pyramids, to their mysteries, unsolved even centuries later.   Two hours later.               - You see, this is a preserved fragment of cladding," Bill pointed to the smooth stone surface at the foot of Khufu's tomb. The stone was so smooth that you could only find a seam on it with the help of shadow, wind, and sand. - You could try putting a hair on the seam and it would slide off.   No one even thought to check it... except Ilya. He lifted his hat, tugged himself up by a black lock of hair, and placed a black strand of it on the stone. Ilya carefully tucked it to the seam, but as soon as the wind blew, the hair flew away, never catching in the gash.   - Fucking... ahem, bloody power! - Weasel exclaimed. - How did they do that?   - If I knew, I'd get a couple of million pounds for scientific discovery.   It clicked in Ilya's head.   - Are you cooperating with Muggles?   - Well, yes," Bill answered easily.   Meanwhile, most of the Weasleys were looking at the hieroglyphics, and Mr. and Mrs. were chatting with a Prophet reporter who wanted to snap up the family for an article about the winnings. In short - a ministerial commission.   - Wow," Ilya whistled. - Magic and science.   - What were you thinking. Or do you have any analogues to spectral or hydrocarbon analysis in mind? I don't go into tunnels and caves without any Muggle gadgets lately.   -And they didn't malfunction? - I was surprised, because at school even the cassette player started malfunctioning and eventually died.   - It happens," Bill shrugged, watching Ronald as he began to climb the blocks of the pyramid for some reason. If this had been a Muggle excursion, the redhead would have been fined in no time, and his parents would have been reprimanded for irresponsibility. - But for the most part, after an autopsy, magical it is lowered for a while and you can work with Muggle explorers for a week... and explorers.   - Does your dad know?   - About the explorers? - With a chuckle in his voice, Bill asked.   - Yeah," Ilya grimaced. - "That's what it's about. About you and the Muggles being on the mellow side, of course!   - No," Bill was suddenly horrified, and even jerked to the side. - And I hope he doesn't find out. Can you imagine him torturing me to find out this or that mechanism?   Ilya shuddered, too, knowing full well Arthur's love of all such things.   - I can't imagine and I don't want to imagine...   The man and the young man looked at each other and nodded, agreeing to keep the secret until the end of time. And not to give it away, even under torture, to the Hydra unit. Ilya put his face in the sunlight. It was pleasant to communicate with Bill, if only because he did not make distinctions between those with whom he communicated. He chatted on equal footing with both his father and little Jean. That's what you'd always call a boyfriend.   - Where did you get the tattoo? - He was suddenly asking the researcher with a strange intonation.   - I can't tell," Ilya sighed dejectedly. - Or else I'd have an axe in my head.   Bill was silent for a while, and then suddenly he laughed out loud and tearfully, drawing everyone's attention to himself for a moment. Ilya didn't even have time to scowl, he just didn't understand what caused such a wave of laughter.   - Jinxx in his repertoire," Destroyer said through laughter.   - You know her," the Slytherin asserted rather than asked.   - Yeah," Billius nodded, and then suddenly lowered his voice to a rather vulgar whisper. - Did you see she had tattoos all over her body?   - sort of.   Bill suddenly winked.   - She's got a rim on something else, too, and I'll tell you...   - That's it! - Ilya shrieked suddenly. - I don't even want to hear about it.   - But...   - Everything I needed to know about it, you already told me. Spare my vulnerable childlike psyche from such details.   - And what she can do with her tongue...   - You're a pervert," Ilya exhaled.   Bill laughed again and slapped Ilya on the shoulder. If he hadn't had experience with bears, he would have buckled from the slap, but he didn't even stagger.   - And how did you get the idea," Ilya went on. - I'm not talking about makeup right now, but she's got a dozen pounds of paint on her.   - I'll say three words - alcohol, club, toilet.   - I'm either going to throw up or whatever the fuck else is going to happen," Ilya turned green.   - You're just a kid," Bill smiled.   - I'm not a kid, but I'm certainly not going to be tumbling around with a walking watercolor. And no alcohol, no club, let alone a shithole toilet, would work here.   - It was quite clean... before us.   - It's perverse, indeed.   Bill continued to chuckle, and Ilya realized that he thought he was a daredevil for nothing. Billius-mother-Weasley, could have given Weasel a hundred points of advantage in "daredevilism," and he would still be a mile ahead. But, one couldn't help but notice. That the two-hour excursion under Bill was terrific. Not only did the Destroyer know everything about the subject of his work, but he was simply a fan of that very work. Ginger seemed to enjoy life to the fullest and was truly happy. Surely, in Einalege's mirror, he would only see his own reflection, and that was damn good.   - Bill, Ilya," Mrs. waved. - Come this way. We're going to take pictures.   - Let's go kid," the first son tapped the boy on the shoulder again and they headed toward the group.   Nine people in one picture, so that the pyramids were in the background, is not very easy. So it is not surprising that in the end the autograph started to grind unpleasant swearing through his teeth. In the end, out of twenty clicks and flashes, the reporter from the prophet was satisfied with only one picture, which had neither darkened nor lightened corners. When the picture came out of the huge machine. Called a magic professional camera, Ilya saw that the figures in the pictures behave differently. But unlike the portraits, they were just repeating the same set of movements over and over again. It was not an imitation of life, but rather a short film for five seconds. Weasel himself was in the picture running his fingers across the brim of his hat and then winking and smiling. Quite normal.   - I'll walk you to the hotel," Bill said as the photographer and reporter took off in an unknown direction.   - Are we leaving already? - Ilya seemed to have the ground beneath his feet.   - So the tour is over," replied the Mrs.   - But... but... we haven't been inside yet!   - They're taking muggles there today-no way," Bill said calmly. He was probably used to it a thousand times himself. - He was still a little shy, he thought.   Weasel shuddered. He knew perfectly well that the phrase "next time" was practically synonymous with "never," and the young wizard of Scary Square could not miss such a chance.   As the group turned toward the portal pad, Ilya suddenly launched his firebomb a little to the side. The explosion was enough to raise a cloud of sand, in which everyone immediately started sneezing and even squeaking (it was Ron, not Jin). At this point, Ilya sprinted like a stung man to the pyramids. Running on sand was somehow much easier than running on lined stone, and it seemed to Ilya that it was just as easy on grass as it was on sand. And if the young man looked down at that moment, he would see that his feet didn't sink at all into the sand layer and his feet didn't leave even the slightest hint of traces. Ilya didn't notice how he covered the distance of nearly one kilometer in less time than the world record holder gets for the hundred meter run. All this "stealth" was akin to the way the Indians did not see the ships of conquistadors, standing in their coves, and noticed only when they boarded the boats. For one cannot notice what one is not prepared to understand.   He was in the middle of a group of Muggle tourists who were being led by a guide to the entrance to the pyramid of Khufu. By the way, the guide was another lady, this time a young lady, twenty-seven years old at most. She was rather pleasant looking, but a little bit mangy and stammering in consonants. Apparently she had a stutter when she was a child. The weasel, with his hat slightly down over his eyes, stood beside the family, there was no other word for it.   There were stereotypes to suit all tastes - a burly, sweaty father who wore a handkerchief and said that they didn't get that kind of heat in New York and that it was better to go to my mother in Florida than to travel halfway around the world. Mother, a thin and long stick, who had put on all the jewelry that could be, and now whined that her fingers and ears hurt, but because of the swelling could not be removed. And, of course - son, which could fit two Ilya, so he was fat, and his face was not ugly. Weasel even grinned, and thought in his mind, that the complete set of these Americans lacked only bespectacled cord with a scar on his forehead. For the complete set, so to say. Stereotypes are like that - pick up the corner of the carpet and you'll find a hundred of them.   - Please don't lag behind, anything can happen to you in these ancient passages," said the guide in an ominous voice.   Weasel grinned a little. He had never liked American accents; it was as if they had had a weight put on their tongue as children and had forgotten that English had shades no less euphony than the velvet notes of French, or the echoes of a German march.   Ilya, almost going under the shadows of the barely dispersed darkness of the pyramids, looked around. There, in the distance, he saw four black figures moving toward the pyramids. Well, he had about half an hour before they'd find him and give him yet another headache. Was it worth it? Of course it was.   Ilya was plunged into darkness. The passage, rather narrow and cramped, even less than two metres in height, was lit only by fluorescent lamps hung in the corners. The guide began her story, in which she first mentioned those who first passed through here centuries later, and the famous interpreter who had first cracked the mystery of Egyptian hieroglyphics. The burly American was just beginning to grumble about how he couldn't see these very hieroglyphs. Ilya was ready to kick him in the ass, if only he would move his hams faster. Weasel's time was running out, and soon there would be angry mages who would hardly be pleased with such a feint. And the young man had yet to see the most intimate of all - the queen's hall.   - Here, around the bend," the lady added again to her voice of mystery, "the real passages of the pyramid begin. Be careful, for who knows what traps the explorers missed.   The particularly sensitive ones shuddered, some of the children snuggled into their parents' warmth. Ilya only clutched the handle of his butterfly in his pocket. Even though it bordered on the theatrical absurdity, it was calmer that way.   And before the turn, the smart illuminators did not hang the lamps on purpose and the archway played with shadows in the shimmering dusk. The tourists passed in a chain, the most dexterous ones even managed to click their cameras without flashing, ignoring all the prohibitions and fines. Ilya's turn came. He took a deep breath and took a step, and then realized that the step was still going on.   In the lower abdomen it felt as if the lad had missed a step, a band flashed on, going further away, and the young man went tumbling down some kind of chute. Above, above his head, a seemingly monolithic slab slowly rose back up.   A few abrasions, bruises and bruises later.               Ilya tumbled straight to the floor of some compartment and only a hitherto unknown to him feeling, helped him in flight to roll over and fall on his toes and fingers, curving in a strange arc. He was lying on his ass and after a moment he was rubbing everything that could be rubbed, because he had fallen and rolled on the chute and he was beating up badly. And the flight from a height of almost three meters did not add to the short journey proper comfort.   When the pain subsided, the young man rose to his feet. There was darkness all around, acrid, viscous, like tarry divorce. But there was no fear, only that languid anticipation, like that of a lover waiting on a white sheet for his naked beloved.   - Adventure," Ilya muttered, the echo echoing off the nearby walls. - And no Trio at my side. Dreams fucking come true.   Ilya began to wait for his eyes to get used to the darkness, but for some reason it didn't happen. He was not working on his cat-animagic abilities here, which was not very pleasant. Well, at least he landed on four paws, which is already good. So he hadn't been dragging his panties in the den for nothing.   The weasel, baring his wand, drew his lighter from his pocket. The flint clicked, the gasoline flame burst into flames, and a small flame appeared in the young man's hands. They say that if you hold a gasoline Zippo for a long time you can get a burn, but Ilya did not believe in such myths. Once he once held a Zippo all day long on a dare, until it ran out of gasoline. No burn was left on his palm, but when Seamus tried to touch the lighter, he almost melted his finger, and then spent another week sulking at the Slytherin for playing such a bad joke on him.   Why didn't Ilya use Lumos, because who knows what will be ahead. And to use the wand, you have to "skewer" the white ball first, and then act in the dark. No, that was too stupid. So he reached forward with his left hand and searched in the glow of the fire for a way out.   - Well, where's my dear one? Go to your father, I won't hurt you...   Ilya knew from books that in such situations it is necessary to listen not only to your thoughts, but also to your voice, otherwise you can get lost in your own experiences and illusions. There was a way out, Ilya had no doubt, and all that was left to do was to find it. At some point the flame of the lighter flickered and curved slightly.   - There you are," Ilya came closer and saw a gap in the wall just big enough for a man of average height who didn't have a beer belly to fit through.   Ilya stood sideways (there was no way that a spear could fly out) and moved forward. Occasionally, curious-looking niches with a treacherous glint of gold, or other hieroglyphs depicting herons whose eyes gleamed with the facets of stones, would come into view. But Ilya did not even think of taking out his knife and digging something out. First, what if a trap, and then - where to put all this stuff, if he did not even know how long he would have to wander. After all, the pyramid is huge, and there are passages There could be a lot of passages hidden from a common person's eyes. There's a reason the Destroyers are still exploring it.   - Where my heel and I are going is a big, big secret, and we won't tell anyone - no, no, no, no, no.   Ilya hummed some line that the Slavic priest often repeated as he went deeper into the church to get some snacks for the orphans. After exactly two hundred and twenty-two steps the tunnel ended, and the lad found himself in a new room.   It was so much bigger than the last one, so much so that a paperclip, enlarged by a spell, thrown upward, fell to the floor before it touched the ceiling. But not only was the vault high and distant, but the outermost wall went somewhere far away, lost in the blackening abyss. Ilya picked up the enlarged staple with his levitation charms and hurled it across the hall with force. Two, four, almost seven seconds. There was a first clang, and then a second - first hitting the wall, then falling to the floor. Ilya estimated in his mind that the room was forty meters long, if not fifty.   - Fuck, what am I, an airplane that could walk around the hangars? - Weasel grumbled and went on his way.   He felt like Gandalf in Moria. He was holding a small light in his hand, and all around him were the mysterious vaults of an ancient structure, whose pillars were lurking with orcs, pardon me - orcs.   Ilya continued to count the steps and hum his favorite tune of the immortal Bob Marley. It helped him not to get lost in the depths of his mind and not to suffer illusions of shadows, eager to reach his throat.   At the thirtieth step, the flame suddenly trembled and abruptly went out.   - What the...   Ilya began to flick the flint, but the sparks did not ignite the fire. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.   - Light it up already! - Ilya shouted.   There was another click, and then the wild roar of a turbine, or maybe a dragon. The eyes were stabbed with a bright flash, and for a moment it was even blinding. Ilya turned toward the wall, toward which he had been walking, and froze with gaping eyes. A huge wall of roaring, spitting orange flame was moving toward him. It was five meters high-just as high as the vault-and eight wide, caressing the walls with its tongues. From behind there was a loud thud of stone hitting stone. Ilya realized that the slab had slammed shut, blocking the entrance to the escape tunnel.   - Fucking hell, you're on fire," the young man whispered.   The balls in my head started spinning at breakneck speed. Thoughts were changing with such speed that after a couple of moments, Ilya had discarded about a dozen rescue options, choosing the craziest one out of them.   The boy immediately squatted down, limiting his own body area by a factor of three. Then he mentally grasped the space around him and uttered a simple   - Wingardium Leviossa.   It didn't even require a tangible amount of strength, no more difficult than picking up a feather. And Ilya felt a light film of wind cover him. And the wall had almost reached the uninvited guest. Not much time remained and Ilya closed his eyes. No, not out of fear, but to avoid burning his retinas. The heat of the underworld licked his back, lava from the molten arc near his foot, but Ilya was unharmed, and the flames went further and soon collided with the opposite wall, splitting into small stars that rolled across the molten floor.   Ilya got up and looked around. He was standing on an island in a sea of solidified lava, from which dark clouds of evaporated dust were rising. How had the young man survived? Oh, in case you haven't guessed yet, Ilya won't bother explaining himself. Perhaps some day later.   There were new sounds of rustling stone, and streams of cold air rushed into the room. The dust settled and the lava turned into a cold crust. But it shuddered and crackled, and the room was back to its original state. Yes, if only people who were devoid of sorcery had participated in the construction, then the traps were clearly set by experienced magicians. The weasel would eat his hat if he had just escaped the fate of being burned by something other than High Magic.   - You're on fire, girl," the boy snickered, flicking his flint.   This time a long-awaited, but importantly, miniature flame appeared. Ilya even exhaled, because he had involuntarily held his breath before. The weasel moved on.   Three hundred and thirty-three steps later           Another stone scraping sound was heard behind him, cutting off the room from the sleeve.   - You've got to be kidding me," exhaled Weasel, who was expecting nothing like this adventure.   Weasel stood in the middle of the room and understood what was about to happen next:   - Cunt...   The student's voice was drowned out by the rumble of falling water. Tons of water poured from the walls in front and behind. But it wasn't clear or blue, it was acid green. And everything in contact with it began to hiss and distort, melting within itself. Acid! That was what it was and nothing else.   Once again, only biting his lip, the Slytherin's sharp mind and wit found a way out. Three times his wand flashed, three times his lips whispered an incantation, and three of the simplest of shields lit up around the young man. One in front of him, one under his feet, and the last over his head. An anti-interference charm. The simplest, most elemental protection, repelling any physical matter with suitable vector-direction and velocity characteristics. Even a child could do it.   "No time for numerology, asshole," Ilya mentally yelled at himself and with a wild howl:   - This is spartaaaaaaaaa," he rushed at the wall of green acid.   But there was no collision this time either. The acid simply flowed around the young man, and he kept running, as if Moses had parted the sea. Soon there was a shimmering gap ahead, through which for some reason the deadly liquid could not seep. When there was not much left to the exit, Ilya simply jumped, flying into the saving passage. Behind him it was as if the jelly froze. Jelly that would eat you to the core.   - Let's get some rest," Ilya muttered, sliding down the wall.   He soon noticed that the acid drops had burned his body and literally ruined his shirt. Well, a few sharpened burns and minus one shirt, it's certainly better than house music you can't hear anymore. Another spell of High Magic was left behind, defeated by the first year of Hogwarts, truly - better than the school of magic on this fucking blue-green ball.   Four hundred and forty-four steps later   - And why am I not surprised," Ilya rubbed his temples, when now in the third room he heard the sound of an overlapping passage behind him. And he'd spent nearly an hour trying to avoid any kind of trap. What tricks he tried, what charms he did not use, and all to no avail.   Here, unexpectedly, the lighter again distinguished itself. The lighter was suddenly distinguished again, and its short flame stretched into a solid column, touching the high ceiling.   "Profane," thought Ilya, casting a head bubble spell over himself.   The whole atmosphere around, if the lighter was to be believed, was one solid caustic gas, which must have had fatal consequences. Breathe one and you're dead. So why didn't Ilya die from the first breath? Have you ever been to the Scary Square dump? No? Well, the fumes there are so bad that even the rain in the landfill area is obviously acidic.   The weasel was slightly led, everything faded for a moment, but he caught his breath in the bubble and calmly walked on, lighting his way with a huge candle.   As one of my favorite characters said - it did not take the entire army of many thousands of Greeks to pass through the Trojan Wall. All it took was one clever king, a dozen warriors and a wooden horse...   - &lsquo;Forks neck," the room whispered.   It was actually "Moved On", but the head bubble charms have their drawbacks.   Five hundred and fifty-five steps later               - Alone," Ilya said.   - Two.   It's been a little while.   - Three!   And at the same instant, a replica of the previous ones swept across the room:   - Smash! - the door behind him closed, for the third and fourth time, cutting off Illya's escape route.   And this time, no amount of subterfuge helped the guy avoid the trap.   - And what have you got this time, faggot...   All one letter was not enough for Ilya to complete the phrase, as the ground shook. Without a second's hesitation, Weasel flopped down on his stomach, and he did it for good reason. In the center of the room huge powerful arms began to emerge from the ground, which created a killer rumble, to which even the roar of an airplane turbine was losing.   The earth-grippers shared what they were supposed to - they were grabbing everything around them. But since there was nothing to grab, the earth-grippers clenched in the air with a terrifying clatter, turning into huge fists.   Again Ilya found the solution at once. His mind was as sharpened as the boarding sabre of a pirate, but at the same time of Sir Francis Drake, who had brought victory to the English on his black sail, in a battle with many times the superior forces of the Spaniards. And this same, sharpened mind, without knowing fatigue, struck mercilessly and without knowing a miss, opening up more and more opportunities where others saw only dead-end hopelessness. Another of High Magic's spells stood no chance against the one who bears the nickname of Weasel.    Ilya sprawled and jumped. The huge stone palm closed beneath him, forming a fist, just a couple of strokes of the heart not enough for this golem to break the young man's legs and topple him to the ground. But now the grip began to loosen his fingers, and Ilya, looking around, jumped again, wobbling, but steadying himself.   And so, time after time, with inhuman agility, developed by persistent training until his veins were whistling, with the feline grace that came from studying animagogy until his nose bled. Ilya, holding his hat with his hand, jumped on the stone arms, one touch of which would have broken every bone in his body.   Soaring into the air one last time, Weasel tumbled through the air and fell on the other side of the barrier, taking away the inertia with a roll. Ilya rose, shook himself off, ran his fingers over the brim of his hat, and then spat.   - Know our people! - He shouted and moved on, into another corridor.   Six hundred and sixty-six steps later           This time Ilya did not even have to try to avoid being trapped. As soon as the tunnel ended, the young man, ready for anything, or almost anything (you're never usually ready for a hundred naked gurias with jugs full of wine), stepped onto the cold stone of the new room.   He had barely touched the cape of the masonry when the oil lamps on the walls began to glow, thinning the darkness subtly. Weasel waited a moment, then shrugged and moved on. Each step responded with a pounding heartbeat. Seconds, even minutes passed, and still no danger presented itself. Ilya grew nervous. The uncertainty was more frightening than any other trap, for the mind itself began to play with reality, throwing up more and more incredible pictures, the outcome of which was one - death.   But still the pyramid did not break with tradition. A metallic clang sounded ahead. Ilya pulled the lighter forward and pointed the wand at the intended target. His heart raced like a galloping mare, and he still had no idea what awaited him there, where rays of flaming oil tickled the gloomy shroud of darkness.   And then it came out. A sexless, majestic creature. It was a sphinx, easily recognizable by its feline body and human face. Except it wasn't made of flesh not of stone, but of interwoven metal plates that fluttered like the wings of a dragonfly. And the tail of the iron golem, so huge that it could have pawed Hagrid, left long and deep cuts on the walls. The creature was six feet long and four feet tall.   There was a terrible growl, not unlike that of an animal, tinged with steel and imminent doom. It was as if Ilya felt a kinship between the metal and the cloth that was sewn into the hat and from which the bandana was made. It was simple - no spell Ilya was capable of would penetrate the monster's defenses. And certainly not a man competing in agility with a sphinx, albeit an artificial one. It was an absolute trap, an imminent death, a closed dead end.   Ilya turned around - the door wasn't closed. So it wasn't a dead end, because he could have escaped. It was easy enough to turn around and dash off into the blackening pit. And the sphinx was still there, as if waiting to decide - fight and die, or run away and do not forget. But this time Ilya felt no ambivalence.   The prince inside the boy longed for a fight worthy of the last stand of the age, and the ugly man was used to blood and pain, used to the idea that any foe would be vanquished merely by drawing the blade that lay in his breeches pocket. Weasel turned his back on the door and stepped forward.   The sphinx ducked, snarling, jostling the plate like a circular saw. Just one touch, one wrong move, and the young man would be in little pieces. Not even the right movement and speed at his limits would save him in this cage, as if specially adapted to the dimensions of the beast.   - Come here, you iron-assed scum," Ilya growled.   And the sphinx obeyed, he jumped, Ilya jumped too. The golem flew back, and Weasel, throwing a firebomb under his feet, rushed back. An explosion, dust, and a roar. The mad roar of a monster whose paw struck a paw whose plates crumpled and tangled in the masonry.   And then, without waiting for his heart to beat, Ilya threw a second bomb, into which he poured almost all his strength. The fireball, the size of a basketball, crashed into the stone vault, and there was a deafening crash. And then the stone slammed against the iron again, and this time there was a rattle, a final rattle of death.   The dust settled and the following became visible. The sphinx's right front paw was wrinkled like a notebook page, sunk into a treacherous hole. And the monster's head and neck, had been pierced by a huge block that had been knocked out by the explosion. Ilya staggered a little, but not from suffocation like the last time, because he had little strength left.   But with a straightening and a jutting chin, Weasel walked boldly toward the exit that opened in the opposite direction. However, when he reached the defeated golem, he stopped parallel to his head. Gabou wanted to smoke wildly, but he prudently left a pack of cigarettes in his trunk. So once again he had to spit.   - I'd call you Goliath," the Slytherin sniggered, estimating the size of a pebble through the head of an invincible foe that could not be defeated by magic or sword. - But you're already dead, so you don't appreciate the humor.   And with those words, Ilya left another trap room. Leaving behind another deadly danger.   Seven hundred and seventy-seven steps later   Ilya was tired. He was exhausted, moving on his last breath, clinging to the wall like a lunatic to the railing of an insane asylum. His bruised legs ached and groaned with every step. His back, covered in small acid burns, crackled with every awkward movement. My sides, stretched by the frantic leaping amongst the stone arms, prevented me from breathing properly. Lungs, scorched by the wall of fire, cried out from too much stale air. And his gut, his gut kept tearing up to lose consciousness due to magical exhaustion. On a normal day, Weasel would have felt only mild malaise after that bombshell, leviosa, shields and the like, but all together it was too much for an almost fourteen year old boy.   And then, when Ilya was already hoping to see the light at the end of the tunnel, he counted off another hundred and eleven steps and found himself in a new room.   - And his death is the death of an inglorious bastard," grinned the young man as he recited a line from an old book.   This was a trap he would probably not survive, and yet Ilya waddled on. He staggered on in the dark, for he had no strength to hold the lighter, no support, for there was none here but the steel rod that had never broken inside. He simply staggered onward toward the mad goal, unwilling to admit what fools call powerlessness.   But then the torches burst forth. Dozens, hundreds of torches in a single burst lit up in a bright flame, blinding Weasel. He couldn't withstand even that and fell. He fell like a wounded swan that had been soaring through the sky. But fallen does not mean surrender.   The young man lifted his head, aching from the pain in his spine and neck, and saw. There, at the very end of the room, instead of another exit, was a golden throne. It was a throne not unlike the one that stood in Buckingham's palace. Buckingham's throne, seemed like a village stool compared to this King of Thrones. There was enough gold alone to feed all of Africa and still be left to help South America. And that's not counting the precious stones which shone in countless numbers, comparable only to the number of stars rolling out every night in the clear black sky. And then there's the historical value...   But Ilya wasn't paying attention to the throne, he was looking at the one sitting on it. It was a skeleton, an ordinary skeleton, not a mummy or anything, but a bone-weigher, so ancient. That his bones were already yellowed, and there wasn't even a thread of the expensive clothes he'd last sat in in his sparkly yellow chair. His arms were crossed in the manner of all dead pharaohs, and his eye sockets, those empty bloody eye sockets, even after death looked with defiance and contempt.   And Ilya laughed his usual laughter, which could be mistaken for springtime dripping. And the walls echoed him, raging in wild laughter.   -I'm going to get slaughtered by some centuries-old corpse... - ...suddenly wheezed out by a guy lying there. - I am the mother of your pharaohs and queens, Ilya the fuckin' Ilya of Scary-break-it-hole-Square!   And Weasel got up, got up on unsteady legs, shivering like an autumn leaf in a squall wind, got up and walked. He staggered, clenching his teeth to the blood from his gums, clutching his wand to the blood from his palm, but he walked nonetheless. He fell, smashing his nose on the stone, swallowed blood from his gums and lips, and got up again. And he walked again, squeaking with everything he could squeak, moaning in every way, and cursing everything, even the things he would never have cursed.   He fell and his bones crunched, but got up and his veins groaned. His face was covered with blood, his lips were parted as if he had kissed an iron horse (a torture instrument), but he kept walking, alternating between ups and downs. When only a step was left to the throne, Weasel fell again. But this time his hands did not obey him, his legs did not obey him, and his backbone seemed to have disappeared from his body altogether.   After walking all the way through the blood and pain, Ilya prostrated himself before the dead man's feet, before his throne of gold and stones. He had to grovel before everything that he hated with all his soul, everything that this fucking chair and the corpse that sat on it represented.   And do you think at that moment something awoke in Ilya that could move all the mountains and defeat any, the strongest enemy? Or that one of his distant ancestors appeared to him and handed him secret knowledge? Or that the floodgates of the universe opened and magic itself flowed into the wizard's battered and wounded body? No, none of that had happened.   Only two minutes have passed. Only a hundred and twenty clicks on the broken clock... Ilya opened his eyes and roared like a wounded buffalo; he grasped his arm with his teeth, biting it down to the meat and began to rise. Through the pain obscuring his eyes, through the cries of tendons and cries of muscles, through the pleas of the mind to stop and let his heart stop beating, through the wild cold of the old woman with the scythe, Gayu rose to his knees, and then made a tug.   It was a blur and a clenched fist flew out and into the dead man's skull. And as the bloodied knuckles touched the ancient matter, it crumbled to ashes, creating not a single obstacle. Ilya, not having a chance to cope with inertia, collapsed on the throne, throwing a cloud of bone dust into the air.   And the second hand started running again, and then there was a youthful laughter. Though it was probably the laughter of a man who had grown up a little, because he'd realized something. He understood about Hufu, about Flitwick, and, importantly, about himself.   Khufu, the greatest Pharaoh, was the first man, a simple man, who defeated the Dark Lord. With his sword he defeated all the power of the magic of darkness and blackness. And he walked away, waiting for a foe of equal strength. An opponent who would overcome all the power of magic, and fight him - with Khufu. And Ilya overcame. He, the weakest student of the course, went through the Highest Magic of all the elements, fought a creature that was immune to this very Highest Magic, and then blew Pharaoh himself into molecules.   Could Ilya have taken the throne, or even the smallest stone, with him? The throne was unlikely; the stone, of course, for it was his booty. But today he had a prize far more desirable than the clinking of gold and the rustling of bills.   What did Flitwick, who did not speak a word in the "lessons" from his young apprentice, want? Something the apprentice could never achieve or understand. Flitwick wanted to burn the fear out of the young man, the fear of his weakness and the power of other mages. Those who spell lengthening can shatter a table and the ancient masonry beneath it, or use repulsive charms to break through a sheet of lead half a meter thick. Flitwick wanted to make it clear to Ilya that he didn't have to survive - he could win.   Flitwick wanted his ward to understand, not know. That all martial arts were created by the weak, to protect them from the strong. So that he would remember... ...if only Bruce Lee, a man who never knew defeat, and who only weighed half a hundred kilos. But a man who, from the age of six, trained hard to get bloody bubbles out of his nose. Remembered Kennedy, the most powerful man of his time, who had been defeated with a simple sniper rifle.   Remembered Macedonian, Khufu, Yaroslav, Ayamak, and many others who defeated Dark Lords and Great Black Mages without having magic in their souls, only holding their sword firmly in their hands.   Flitwick wanted the young man to get rid of his fear. From that cursed fear that chained birds to the nest, and people to their parents' home and the comfort of a warm hearth. He wished that the wizard, wielding both wings, would finally soar into the sky and soar high above on par with the one who had decided to teach.   What prey did Ilya get? Ilya got his best weapon, which cannot be withstood or defended against - a sober, sharp mind. Ilya got the best shield, which is ready to reflect any attack and protect whoever he takes under his wing - a brave heart. And Ilya also received the greatest strength that nothing else in this world can resist - faith, faith in oneself.    And was there a need for gold or jewels after that? Great powers of magic or ancient artifacts? Secret knowledge or majestic ancestors? No, only two words were needed.   - I have won! - The young man shouted at the top of his lungs.   Ilya felt himself begin to swell, like a balloon, to then disintegrate into millions of small parts.   Only a moment later.           Ilya opened his eyes and didn't even squint when the sun darted its sharp ray into his face. The weasel was lying in front of the pyramids of Giza, on a small stone plateau in the sand. And there in the height the clouds were floating, covering the blue of the sky behind them.   - Ehabarkaim!   - Nukahebe!   Ilya turned his head and saw two men running toward him, baring their wands. The sun gave the young man strength, as if washing him with gentle hands and rekindling inside the almost extinguished flame, always going hand in hand with the black-haired, now - young man. But the strength was still too little to stand up. But here Ilya saw the emblems on the Arabs' turbans. They were the zankees of the Guardians.   - Scum! - Weasel shouted suddenly, jumping to his feet. - Shameful wolves! You can't catch me. You bastards!   And Ilya ran. Not even realizing that it was impossible to run in his standing position. But still a spell hit his back, and the world was plunged into darkness.    A week later.           A week, that's how long it took Bill to shake his connections and hush up the "tomb robbers Ilya Ilya" case. And it was because the lost crown of the ancient pharaohs had somehow turned up on the young man's head. The young man himself, sitting in jail, believed that the cops planted him this trinket, in order to unwind the British on the debt. Ilya could have sworn on his mother that he hadn't taken the crown with him from that cave. He didn't take anything at all! In fact, the cops did not even believe in the existence of the cave. He was a little too young to be in the cave, but the cops didn't even believe there was a cave.   - Where is he?! - She shouted a furious Mrs. Weasley, flying into the Watchmen's station.   She was followed by Mister, Bill and Abi Bai, who acted as both a knowledgeable interpreter and something else. The two Guards who were to hand over the "exonerated" were taken aback by such an impudence.   - The poor boy had suffered such a nightmare - lost on a Muggle excursion (that was the official version, soon invented by Ilya), and you locked him up for a week! Yes, to the most egregious criminals! Speak now, or I'll blow this place to Mordred's mother!   The guards, of course, did not bear the surname Ilya and did not know that witches should not be angry, but even without a translation they blasted away. They grabbed the magic keys and raced to the cell. A fury named Molly Weasley followed them like a kite after unfortunate prey.   With trembling hands the Sentinel poked at the lock. The door opened with a creak, until at last the spring clicked and the door opened with a creak. Molly wanted to rush in, but was still frozen on the threshold.   There was a smiling Ilya sitting on the floor, strumming his guitar among the cots and some fat men in tattoos. It was clearly not his. With some drunken faces and exactly the same drunken intonations, people were voicing in different tones, drowning out Ilya's own voice:           Vladimir's Central (Northern Wind)   By way of Tver.   There's a heavy burden on my heart   Vladimir's Central (Northern Wind)   When I was banked (Life is changed)   But it's not the point that usually ruins it.   And by eleven, an ace.   - Are they drunk? - Abi whispered in the Sentinel's ear.   - They are Russians," shrugged the Arab, moving aside from Madame. - They can bleed themselves and drink it. There's more alcohol than blood anyway.   Suddenly the guitar fell silent, as did the song in a language that was beautiful but foreign to the ear.   - Oh," I could see that Ilya was a little dazed. - Brothers, my freeloader is here. Well, peace to your house.   Leaving his guitar on the bunk, Weasel rose to his feet and staggered towards the exit.   - Hey, Musician," said the stoutest, fattest convict to the wizard. Whose English was even worse than Ilya's French. - If you're in Witch Street, ask for Vityka Thunder. For always help.   - Thank you," Ilya nodded and was off.   The door slammed shut with a creak, cutting off the sound of song. Molly immediately put her arms around Ilya in a bear hug, and he turned suddenly green and put his palm to his mouth. He turned green and put his hand to his mouth. Who pushes a drunk like that?   - Now, be honest, young man," said the missus suddenly. - Where have you been?   - Ohhhh," Ilya stretched out, with three guardians in front of him at once. - I walked through the valley of the shadow of death amidst a land of chaos and despair, and Cthulhu himself whispered to me: "Laaaaaaans, who's going to go after Cliink, Laaaaans?"    After that Grebert, holding up his hat, threw up after all. What had the hat got to do with it? Ilya could not afford to lose his style and charm, even by vomiting alcohol and stale bread. The trip to Egypt was coming to an end.    Chapter 23   September 1, 1993 England, Knigs Cross station platform 9 and &frac34;            The first of September is a wonderful day, a festive day, and an irrevocably awful day in its utter hopelessness. Ilya, still somewhat elongated from the summer, glistening with his bronze tan, evenly laying all over his body, collected a full house of stares.   Not that it annoyed him, but he still didn't like being stared at like a sculpture. He wanted to pick his nose, and he couldn't do it, because there were always people who would notice. A nightmare, in a word. And then there's the Golden Trio, who were supposed to be watching Ilya. Mol Mrs. and Mister had asked the judicious Harry and Granger to keep an eye on the recently reclined Zec. Surprisingly, the boys agreed. Granger because she couldn't pass up the opportunity to boss someone around and show her supposed adulthood. Harry simply because he didn't know how to say no to other people's requests. Ron was the only one who wasn't happy with this turnaround, and neither was Ilya himself.   - Ilya, take off your hat," Granger suddenly demanded as the four wizards finally found an almost empty compartment.   Except for the sleeping man on the top shelf, there really wasn't anyone in it. Ilya, sighing heavily, shoved his trunk under the seat, solely because of the goblin mannerisms grafted onto some part, assisted Hermione in shoving her torch onto a vacant shelf. Discreetly showing the middle finger to the entire trio as they turned to paper and finally stretched out on one of the seats, occupying it completely.   The end of the vacation was just perfect. Ilya was so full of two excursions that he spent all his free time on the beach. There he managed to meet a simply monstrous amount of people. He made friends in Belgium, Ukraine, Japan, Macedonia, France, Germany, Poland, America, Mexico, Brazil, Canada and... He had friends in Belgium, Ukraine, Japan, Macedonia, France, Germany, Poland, America, Mexico, Brazil, Canada. Ilya managed to find a common language with everyone, and in the case of girls, also a place where these languages could touch. Weasel played beach football, volleyball, took part in jumps from the cliff, parachute flights for the boat, in the get-togethers in bars and nightclubs, played strip poker and more interesting things, managed to try all alcoholic beverages and understand their measure, once again escaped from the police, and drove a sports car on the night Sheikh, completely ignoring traffic lights. In general, Ilya had more fun in the six days he had left on vacation than he had in Egypt in a whole month. In the end, it seemed to Ilya that those six days were the longest and most intense in his whole life. There was an unstoppable dance of emotions and feelings that swept over him and left no chance.   Weasel grinned. Hardly another fourteen-year-old could boast of such a summer.    - Ilya...   - Piss off Danger," Weasel snorted, putting his foot on his leg and pulling his hat over his eyes.   If in his first year he could stretch to his full height on the seat, now he lacked space and had to lean with his back against the opposite wall. Through the approaching drowsiness, Ilya heard the click of his heels and the click of the key latch. When the know-it-all returned to his seat, Weasel drew his wand.   - Alohomora! - without looking, he said.   There was another click, letting me know that the lock was no longer locked.   - Hey!" exclaimed Ronald. - Why did you open it?!   - You know," Ilya stretched out. - After you've done your time, you appreciate such niceties as unlocked doors.   - You've only been in detention for a week," the Scary Square wizard didn't see, but suspected that the second best in school, grimaced slightly dismissively.   - When you've done the week yourself, then you can lecture me.   - Mrs. Weasley asked me to keep an eye on you.   - I'll look after whoever you want," Ilya said with a smirk. - But looking out doesn't involve lectures or lectures or anything else.   - Hat...   - Get away from my hat. But if you want me to strip, I might as well start with my pants.   - It hurts me to have you undress," the girl grimaced again.   - Who knows," Weasel shrugged, putting his hands behind his head. - Maybe you got a hormone injection over the holidays after all.   - You're just a horny juvenile delinquent.   - Where did the poser go?   The atmosphere in the compartment gradually heated up, but in time there was someone who always comes in at the right and unnecessary moment.   - Will you calm down already? - He sighed questioningly. - Ron, what do you know about Sirius Black?   Weasel mentally slapped his hand across his face. After such a tumultuous summer, he had expected a year of tranquility in the ancient castle, but it seemed the Wizarding World had its own idea of tranquility. This was the third year in a row that some sort of cavabunga was brewing at the school. The first year had psychotic minions of the Dark Lords, the second year had black-magic artifacts capturing the minds of little girls, the third year had a maniac escaping from the most impregnable prison. At this rate, by the seventh year, Hogwarts will be at war...   - Not much," Red answered rather dejectedly. - Just that he was right-hand man of You-Know-Who and was condemned right after the war. My father said he'd gone mad and killed thirteen muggles, and Peter Peter Petergrew, who was left with only his little finger.   - Nihu... - even Ilya was shocked by such a scope.   - Harry! - Hermione exclaimed. - Mr. Weasley told you to keep your voice down and stay out of trouble. Black is after you, and instead of asking around about him, you should follow the rules and regulations for once in your life.   - Goggles, I'll bite my tongue off, but I agree with Danger. Stick your asshole in the chair, see if the school gets in any less trouble.   - I didn't ask you, you filthy slug!" barked Weasley.   - You're a filthy slug," Ilya rolled the insult around on his tongue. - Look, how about something new? Well, I do not know, disgusting, for example. No, I understand that your mind is not enough for more, but still... I don't know how you got to be like this, Bill or the Twins or even Percy, the smartest guys, but you...   - Oh, you...   - Ron!   Ilya lifted his hat with his index finger and saw Potter holding his flamboyant friend by the forearm. Ron looked at his mate, and the bespectacled man nodded at the unknowing stranger snuggled up on the top shelf. Weasley's attention immediately shifted from one to the other.   - By the way, who's that? - Ronald suddenly lowered his voice to a whisper.   Yeah, well, by golly, a genial fellow. The sleeping man was not awakened by the locomotive whistle or the tapping of the wheels or the drumming of the rain or the past shouting, but now - he would certainly wake up, and so it was necessary to whisper. Yes, in such situations one begins to believe that some people need their head solely to eat into it.   - Professor Lupin, our new ZoT teacher," Hermione replied calmly, scratching the neck of her huge cat, Bellybutton. A perfectly normal cat, with a distinct admixture of magical blood.   However, such a statement made Weasel gasp.   - How do you know? - Potter voiced the question hanging in the air.   - I read it on the suitcase tag," Danger shrugged, enjoying the purr of the shaggy cat.    Ilya put his hand to his face again mentally. How had he not thought to look at the tag himself? Perhaps Ronald's mental awkwardness was airborne. However, Ilya went up anyway to look at that very tag. And indeed, it read, "Professor Remus Lupin, Defense Against the Dark Arts."   - You can Danger," Ilya coughed.   Then he suddenly sucked in air too hard with his nose and froze for a moment. The man smelled strange. Not the way a human should smell, and Ilya had learned everything there was to know about smells over the years. The Slytherin sucked in the air again and again, sniffing and puckering like a leopard on the prowl. Even his facial features took on a slight beastly shape for a brief moment, unnoticed by the others.   This Lupin did indeed reek of the forest, and, rather suspiciously, of wolf. But it wasn't a put-on smell that you put out after a walk or an encounter with an animal, it was this man's personal scent. But even though Ilya loved such smells, the professor smelled a little different. Not pleasantly refreshing, but rather a little dirty and sickly. It was not a real forest and wolf, but only some semblance, and - magical. A sudden hunch crossed his mind.   - Danger, when was the last full moon?   The girl was taken aback and opened her mouth silently.   - Oh, hurry up, I know girls know how to do these things.   - Yesterday," Hermione replied.   Weasel turned around, looked intently at the Trio, and realized that they didn't understand anything.   - Yeah," Ilya stretched out. - Fuck, Grandpa's gone crazy. Maybe I gave him some expired slices. - The weasel bent over, took out his trunk, opened the lid, and began to rummage through the pockets, muttering: - "Where's he... Where'd it go, you little bastard? There you are!   He took out a shiny little thing, which turned out to be a cross on a chain. It was a gift from the priest. But it was not a simple cross, but a cross made of pure silver. And silver is known to be an excellent antidote to those who smell of woods and wolves.   Ilya quickly put the chain under his shirt, and then hung the cross on his chest. He would have to wear it for a year. Why a year? Well, Zotniks don't hold out much longer. Must be too much of a chore. Ilya had little faith in the "cursed position" version.   - All right," Weasel put the trunk back and patted himself on the knees. He pulled a pack of Pirate's Dream from his breast pocket and a Zippo lighter from his back pocket, which now not only bore the emblem of the famous whiskey, but a variety of Junior runes and even one Senior. - Who's up for a smoke break?   The oil painting was a break in the paradigm of existence. Only seeing cigarettes in the hand of a classmate, the homeboys fell into a natural slump and could not even get their eyes together.   - What, no one? - Ilya was a little disappointed.   Over the last few days of rest he had become accustomed to spending his breaks talking rather than proudly alone.   - You... are you... are you smoking?! - Granger burst into tears, blushing at what she thought was blatant behavior.   - Everything is clear with you," Ilya sighed and went out into the corridor, slamming the door behind him.   He was expecting a furious Danger to burst in, but she was either too dazed, or finally realized that Ilya's reeducation was out of her league. And anyway, no one was up to the task.   Ilya went to the window, pulled the handle, and opened the window. A drizzle of whipping rain hit his face, and the night smell hit his nostrils. The train had already passed the city and even the settlement areas and was now puffing among the fields and grasses. Ilya flicked his flint, lit a cigarette, and then took a pleasure inhaling the slightly stupefying smoke, enjoying the aroma of the sea breeze. After holding it in his lungs for a while, Weasel gave out five thick smoke rings - he had been taught to do it by a Canadian, a normal guy who smoked not tobacco but some kind of vegetation, which made Ilya burst into an uncontrollable chuckle.   The night wind caressed my face, carrying white, dense smoke like the clouds of Lilliputian country-small but fluffy. Thoughts slowed down a little, the soul became calmer, and everything around seemed slow and measured. On nights like this, Ilya always wondered how his friends from the shelter. Maybe Rosie was already doing her best to fight off the suitors, and Kevin was helping her with it. It was no secret that Brix was in love with the redheaded kid. No one but the kid herself. As for Gavs, he was probably learning the hard science of boxing, which he was a fan of, going insane in his adoration.   Or maybe the three friends were sitting in their room at St. Frederick's right now, fuming just the same, looking out the window and thinking about how their friend was doing in that strange academy called Hogwarts. And Ilya would, upon hearing such a question, instead of answering, hold out the pile of letters he'd been writing every Friday for the third year now. The room, after each line, would be ringing with laughter and friends would often mock their friend. And he, without blushing, would proudly stick out his chest and lift his chin.   Ilya looked at the half-cigarette. Yes - smoking alone is a shitty thing to do. It always makes me want to philosophize, or something close to it. But then who to smoke with at school? Only two of the older ones smoked, but they were, how should I put it, addicted to each other. I didn't want to join their company. The only other smokers were Snape and Sprout.   Weasel chuckled, imagining him trying to snatch a cigarette from the Half-Eyed Man. Perhaps the Dean would even share - he just wouldn't get over the shock that someone would dare approach him with such a request. That would just be a stunning joke, worthy of a mention on par with Mourning Week.   The cigarette was only a third of the way through, and Ilya's thoughts turned to the new school year. When the list of additional subjects was posted on the bulletin board, the Slytherin didn't even think about which ones to choose. Of course he put his name next to "Numerology" and "Ancient Runes".   Numerology was taught by Professor Vector, the best in her field. In that work, which the young man has been reading for a long time now, even her forums, theorems and examples of solutions of certain equations were mentioned. Ilya was even a bit surprised that a world famous scientist teaches in an ordinary school. But why be surprised if Hogwarts is ranked first in this very world.   Ancient Runes was maintained by Batsheda Babbling, whose last name was also a household name. She was responsible for many translations of ancient texts and manuscripts, and many libraries around the world would have been honoured to host such a distinguished researcher. But the professor preferred to combine work with teaching, and, once again, the best school in the world was ideally suited to it.   Perhaps, once Ilya had started the classes, he would be able to do more research and finally get closer to the main thing: creating his own spells. For that Ilya already had almost everything ready. The first and most important were the ideas for the charms. The second was the structural equations, which was the most important. The calculation of one of Ilya's spells, for example, took up three meters of parchment scroll. All that was missing was the non-verbal component and the Elder Runes.   Ilya, using his unorthodox mind, decided that by combining multiple aspects in his spells, he could create something that would quite equal his chances against any forehead. He was led to this idea by the numerous records of Duel League fights that Flitwick had supplied him. Ilya looked through dozens, hundreds of fights, going over them time after time, noticing every detail, every nuance. And in his mind, spells, their structures, their purposes, their uses, and the ways in which they were used, loomed up. But once again, it was all about nonverbalism and the Elder Runes. Without them, all he could think of were numbers on parchment and images in his head.   Exactly ten charms, exactly ten equations, that's all Ilya got out of himself, knowing that he would never get out again. But if he could manage to master them, if he could use nonverbal magic on par with verbal magic, it would be enough to make his road to the King of Doom's crown a red carpet. It would be enough to "roll the dice" with any lunatic with a wand loaded with magic accumulated over generations of pureblood ancestors or innate talent.   After all, Ilya had his own talent, too, besides music, of course. After all, by his sophomore year he could rival Hog's graduates in fire spells. No matter how weak Ilya was at magic, fire obeyed him as easily as a lighter that lit up with a click. It didn't even require much effort or any amount of magic. As easy as breathing.   The cigarette suddenly went out, and an icy sliver slashed across my cheek.   - What the... - Ilya stretched out, when the train stopped abruptly at full speed.   Ilya was saved from an imminent fall by his reaction and dexterity. He jumped up and grabbed the handrail, landing on his feet a moment later. But that was not the end of the surprises.   The recent rain that had been pouring down outside the window had suddenly turned into hail. And now it was not drops, but stabbing ice balls and needles that were ramming on the glass. And the glass itself began to be covered with a crust of painted frost, crackling in more and more space.   The light in the corridor flickered, and then went out altogether. A liquid but acrid mist spread across the floor, crawling and wriggling like a ball of snakes. Illya began to suffocate. A pungent smell wafted across the floor, like the fumes of a snake. It was rotten, filthy and not even death, but a kind of death. It was as if there were ghosts here, but ghosts that were dense and tangible, that remained in this reality, but no longer alive.   Ilya's stomach twisted, his eyes tingling with the stinking stench. He was in the middle of a fight, and he was trying to concentrate, but then the stench doubled in density.    And when the icy vestibule door creaked miserably, the Slytherin, the only one in the corridor, saw them. They were flying black tatters of cloak, like gaps of an abyss in a sparkling reality. And wherever they floated by, everywhere the light flickered, everything around them turned gray, turning a swampy haze. Suddenly their hands appeared from beneath their cloaks. Ilya had seen enough dead men in his life and had never been afraid of them. But these scab-covered hands, with their hard, parchment skin, were clearly the hands of a corpse, but unlike the others, they were truly frightening.    Because of the stench, Ilya felt wild weakness, his body could not hear him and Ilya collapsed, sliding down the wall. The two cloaks drew nearer, and the cold grew stronger. And with it, the despair grew stronger. It was as if someone had drained him of what seemed to be his inexhaustible joie de vivre. The most terrible memories began to roll in Ilya, but he brushed them off, not wanting to remember and sink again. Ilya had never lived in the past and easily left all evil behind, replacing it with the heat of life.   The two cloaks approached almost closely, but then one suddenly turned sharply away and literally burst into the compartment where Trio was sitting. And that other one, just like that, snapped toward Ilya. And with every centimeter of approach, the stench and fear combined with despair intensified.   Ilya, breathing heavily, literally drowning in sweat, raised his wand. He didn't utter a word or make a single gesture, but a faint jet of flame burst from the tip of his red wand, ornamented with scrolls. Cloak let out a low squeal, recoiled, letting the fire pass behind him, and leaned toward Ilya.   The cloak was thrown back, and Weasel was only able to hold back a gagging urge with shock. There, beneath the hood of black, flowing fabric, was no face. There was only a round, toothless mouth on his head, stretched out like a Scream painting, open like a trumpet. Everything around it swirled in a nauseating whirl, everything faded, and the world focused only on this failure.   Ilya felt that he was falling, falling, and could not grasp, because inside his own mind there was nothing to grasp.            - Look who it is... - heard Ilya.   He opened his eyes and saw an angel before him. That's what he thought for the first ten seconds, until he heard it.   - Say 'mama,'" the angel said in a voice that flowed with streams of honey.   And Ilya heard a childish, very childish voice:   - Ma-ma," and then I realized it was him talking.   It was his throat that emitted those sounds, and it was his chubby little hands, like stretched wieners, that reached for the angel's face. To those fine, perfect facial features, to the chiseled nose and cheekbones, to the perfect cut of deep, bright blue eyes and thick but graceful spreading eyebrows. To the thick, black hair that rivaled the color of a moonless night. A smile so kind, so caring and gentle that I wanted to look at it forever. And to the endless warmth that exuded from this most beautiful of women.   The woman suddenly opened her eyes, fluttering her long lashes like butterfly wings.   - Faust, Faust! - the woman shouted. - Our son has spoken!   At the same moment there was a deafening clatter of feet and a new participant appeared on the stage. Ilya probably should have blinked, frightened, screamed with horror, but he only laughed his laughter, similar to the murmur of spring drip. A man appeared before him. The man's face was not human but shaped like a beast, like a leopard or a lynx.   The narrow eyes sparkled with their animal emeraldness and dilated but still narrow pupils. A body, too inhuman a body, encased in an armor of knotted muscles and veins stretched like steel ropes. And the hair, the man's hair was not red, but bright red, like a newly blooming flower of flame.   But the little boy, the one-year-old child, was not afraid; it laughed and stretched its arms toward this monster in the flesh, as others would call it. But to Ilya this someone was not a monster at all, he was:   - Really? - There was a low, growling voice, like a forest cat's sniffling. - What did you say?   The girl with the angelic face smiled and pecked the child on the nose.   - Baby, tell Daddy again what you told Mommy.   The child laughed and squeaked again:   - Ma-ma.   - It's... it's... fucking...   - Faust! Not in front of the children!   - Oh, yeah, I'm just worried," the red-haired man said. - This is the happiest day of my life! Say "papa," say "papa."   And he held out his hand to the child, a hand so powerful that it would have passed for a paw, even the nails on the fingers were identical to the claws. But again the child was not frightened, but only grasped the finger, topped by a sharp claw, firmly.   - Pa...   But no sooner had the last sound escaped the infant's lips than a terrible rumbling sound struck my ears. The walls trembled, plaster crumbled from the ceiling, the front door flew off its hinges, landing with a pop on the floor, and there, in the darkness dispersed by the glow of the fireplace, Ilya made out a female figure in a dark robe. And then Ilya heard laughter, the maddening laughter of a woman.   - Hide," Faust bellowed the frightened angel. - Hide yourself and hide him. I'll hold her off.   Angel suddenly kissed the red-haired man hotly, and when their kiss ended, Ilya saw surreal long, dangerous fangs protruding from his upper and lower jaws.    The girl threw Ilya into her arms, but for a moment the child's head was over the angel's shoulder, and he saw. He saw the red-haired man turn toward the fireplace and wave his hand. And with that sweep, a torrent of bright, roaring flame swirled, enveloping all the space around it.   Then all the child could see was the blue dress of an angel carrying him in her arms. They were near the wall, the girl pressed something somewhere and a niche opened in the wall.   - Be quiet," the girl whispered suddenly. - I beg you, Ilya, don't make a sound.   Then a kiss on the forehead and the phrase:   - I love you.   Angel pressed something again and the alcove slammed shut. The child was left in the darkness and had only the sound of voices breaking through the crackling flames.   - You thought you were hiding here. Fiery? On this side of the world?   - Don't say that name in front of me.   - And you used to like it," and a laugh, so scary, so crazy.   - Get out, get out now.   - No!" the laughter broke off abruptly into a shriek. - He has fallen!   - What?   - He's fallen! The Dark Lord has fallen! And it's all because of you! You left, you gave up everything for her! ...for a Muggle pipsqueak! But I found you, I found you, and I will punish you for your treachery.   Silence.   - You don't know anything... he never told you.   - Shut up!" and that high-pitched, ear-splitting shriek again. - He was telling me everything; I was the closest thing to him!   Silence again and the crackle of flames.   - Why are you standing there, Fausto? Why aren't you attacking? Or do you think I came here to drink tea? - ...and a laugh, a mad woman's laugh. - Even the Longbottoms were fighting and you're standing there.   - I'm not fighting anymore, Bel...   - Don't you dare!   - Okay, um... I don't fight anymore. I was stupid, and I paid the price for it, but I found something more important than my own hatred. Go away or shoot, but not a drop of magical blood will touch my hands again.   - And why, because of her? Because of a dirty muggle?   - And because of her, too. But also because of the fact that you can't hold children with bloody hands.   - Children? - laughter again; the woman seemed to be laughing all the time, literally gasping in her madness. - You can't have children, you're the last one.   And the laughter never ceased, wild, crazy, like a brand of hardened iron in my subcortex. And then silence and the crackle of flames.   - Still standing?   - Shoot or get out.   - Fausto's last wish? Rejoice in my mercy.   - Don't touch her. Let her go. I was a monster and I have to pay for it, but she's innocent.   - All right.   - Swear it.   - I swear. Farewell Fireman. Bombarda Maxima!   And then a cracking sound, as if someone had cracked a watermelon with a bat, and a terrible cry of pity, mixed with wailing. But that was drowned out by the crazy woman's wild laughter. There was silence as the flames crackled, and then came footsteps. Clear, measured, but interspersed with the clatter of heels and muffled laughter.   - There you are...   - Go away, go away! - The angel shouted, choking back tears.   And laughing, such a nasty, crazy laugh and phrase:   - I lied-- Crucio!   And the screaming...            Something snapped Ilya out of those forgotten memories. It was as if a star had fallen into the valley of despair and fear, woven of happiness and joy. Ilya opened his eyes again, but this time in real time, in the real world, not the one the dreams had thrown up.   Weasel saw the cloaks fly away, shrieking violently, and a silver blur rushed after them, but when his vision returned to normal, for a moment weasel saw in the blur a huge dog. Soon the cloaks and the dog disappeared behind the doors of the vestibule.   - How are you, boy? - There was a man's voice, a little hoarse.   Ilya realized that he was sitting on the floor, drenched in sweat, and the sleeping man was leaning over him. The man's face was haggard and troubled.   - Everything all right? Harry was hurt, too, but at least they didn't try to drink his soul. Here's a candy bar to help.   Weasel brushed aside the chocolate bar and it rolled across the floor. The professor did not take offense at all, and only tried to help him stand up, but was instantly pushed aside. Weasel, holding on to the handrail, got to his feet and suddenly realized that he was cold. For the first time in his life the wizard of Scary Square was cold.   - It's freezing in here," Ilya's voice was a little mechanical, as if he wasn't thinking, just acting on instinct.   Now Lupin was surprised. It was even hotter in the room when the Dementors left, but looking at the young man who had almost been kissed, one would have thought otherwise. Suddenly the tanned skin turned from bronze to yellow, and his lips and nails turned blue.   - We need to warm up," whispered a still uncomprehending Ilya.   The wand soared in a bright spark, the glass shattered, and Weasel leaped out into the street in a fused leap and ran. He ran as fast as he could to fan the flames in his chest, and his path lay through the woods to the place that would surely help in this difficult matter-the Magical Forest.   Ilya could almost hear the worried whispers of the wind and the leaves begging him to hurry, before the flames went out completely, before the young man lost something important that the dead man in the cloak had almost taken. For just a little bit more, just a little bit more, and the Forest would not be able to fan those flames.   Needing to run faster, Ilya ran down the path that emerged beneath his feet, and not even the wind could catch up with him.  Chapter 24.   September 6, 1993 England Hogwarts       Illya had a dream. In the dream an angel sang to him, and that angelic voice drew Ilya deeper and deeper into a whirlpool full of warmth and comfort, from which he did not want to get out. But one way or another Ilya had to open his eyes and part with this divine creature of incredible beauty.   Weasel stretched himself sweetly, squeezing his eyes and wrinkling his nose, and then with a yawn rose to his feet. He was surprised to find himself in a pile of leaves. Someone had covered him with branches and grass, making a blanket of green.   The Slytherin looked around and saw only the morning forest. The crones were whispering their otherworldly stories overhead, the trees crackling and the wind whistling in the grass. And through the tall, dense foliage, rays of light broke through like sharp spokes, playing in the dust of the forest.   Ilya pinched his arm, but it didn't help. He was awake. But reality was so impossible that even the wizard found it hard to believe what was happening. The last thing Ilya remembered was going out for a smoke, and he was attacked by dead ruffians in cloaks and tried to take away his sight, well, or soul. In general - Ilya hung out with Dementors, but they were clearly having some problems with a beautiful third-year and decided villains try him for a tooth. I was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.   The only thing weasel remembered was a dream that flashed: an angelic maiden's face, a clawed paw hand, and some crazy, scary laughter.   - I'm in this mess again," Ilya sighed and slapped his hand across his face. - And it's probably because of Potter again.    Thank the gods of all religions, the hat was still there, as were the rather expensive (by the standards of the bosot) shoes and trousers. The only thing was that the shirt was torn to shreds. Ilya did not hesitate, threw off the rags and hung them on a bough. Maybe the centaurs would pick it up for bandages or something.   There was nothing to do, no ideas, so it was no surprise that Weasel drew a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his pocket, where he found a whole one, then flicked the flint. The smoke swirled, creating spirals and rings, and, with his hat tucked slightly over his forehead, he threw his hands behind his head and strode off down the path that led to Hogwarts.   Occasionally there were animals on his path, often stopping to stare intently at the lad walking along the path. The sun danced playfully on the bronze skin that stretched over his knotted muscles. And the young man, seeing some furry one, took off his hat to greet him. And fluffy, in turn, wagged his tail, flicked his paw, twitched his ear, and then he went on his fluffy business. Everyone had their own thing to do. Someone had to bring something to burrow, someone to get a worm, a bug, a mouse, or even larger prey. Some were caving in a hollow, some were looking for a dam support, and some were just strolling serenely through their territory.   At some point Weasel stopped, bent down and pulled off his shoes. He stuffed his socks into his pockets, and they stuck out comically. The weasel tied the shoes himself by the laces and hung them round his neck.   With pleasure he dug his toes into the still dewy ground, burrowing into the cold, caressing grass. He gave out another batch of smoke rings, and Ilya, not worrying about anything, began to whistle his favorite tune. And as if in tone with this tune three little birds were flying from tree to tree trying to make a trill in time with the tune. Weasel saluted them with his hat. And so the four of them continued on their way through the Magic Forest.   The path looped, leading Ilya along paths unknown to the other traveller, glimpsed at times the strangest trees, more like bushes, and bushes the size of trees. Ilya passed a field of singing flowers, and jumped over a ravine in which the stones laughed, but everything around him seemed a little familiar and quite normal. Even a squirrel dancing a jig with a salamander was something quite ordinary to the young man. But the closer weasel came to the castle, the more ordinary the forest became. Here no more would one encounter a tree with a human face, or a snuffer basking on a rock, or even a special bird with four wings. It seemed that the very essence of the Wizarding Forest was trying to stay away from Hogwarts, revealing only the very edge of true, genuine wonder.   Weasel paused beside the tree for a moment, then smiled and stepped out into the clearing.   - Well done, Harry," he heard Hagrid say in his thick, low bass. - I was a little scared at first.   There were Gryffindor and Slytherin third graders in the clearing, which was a short walk away from Hog's fields. There was a full complement except for Daphne Greengrass and Theodore Nott. Weasel looked at Granger somewhat incredulously. He had reasonably assumed that the nerd would choose to take Numerology and Runes, or at the very least, Muggle Studies. But the fact that the nerd in the skirt would be taking the UZMS Practice.      Hagrid helped Potter down from what might appear to be a huge horse. But the snag was that the horse had eagle claws on its feet instead of hooves, and the head itself was eagle-like, and it even had wings and half of its torso was covered with feathers. In general, it is pleasant for you to get acquainted with hippogriffs, chimeras in which the eagle and the Andalusian stallion were mixed.   Then someone turned his head toward Ilya, who was standing shirtless, leaning against a tree, smoking his cigarette. It was Lavender. She was batting her eyes in disbelief, then suddenly she was eagerly devouring the figure of the young man and tugged at the sleeve of her friend Isabelle, who in turn poked her elbow at Parvati.   - Aloha pioneers," Ilya waved his hand.   Here the Slytherin gathered a full house of stares. And everyone was looking at him with different shades of emotion in their eyes. Malfoy and Co. looked with obvious regret and pity. Some of the Gryffindors looked with surprise, the trio of girls with quite familiar shades of desire from the summer, well, the Trio was in their own spirit and represented the apogee of shock.   - Ilya? - Hagrid spoke up.   - No, I am the shadow of Hamlet's father, come to inform you of a terrible sin.   - Did you lose your shirt for sin? - Suddenly McDougall giggled.   - Yeah," the Slytherin grimaced. - I was so caught up in the sin that I could barely find my pants.   Someone laughed, someone blushed, and Ilya, finishing his cigarette, burned the cigarette butt in the flame of the stick. He was not littering in the Magic Forest.    - Ge... - Hagrid wanted to say something, but didn't have time.   There was a high, high-pitched screech, and by now the focus of attention was across the clearing, where a bloodied Malfoy lay on the ground, clutching his left arm to his chest, three deep slashes showing. A hippogriff was looming over the weakly breathy man, wings flapping violently, then he sprang to a halt, forelegs outstretched, clearly intent on finishing the job.   Alas, between Draco and the chimera arose the forester, whose powerful figure at this moment inspired nothing but consternation. Hagrid waved his arms and began to drive the beast away, which, with obvious displeasure, nevertheless obeyed. And how can one not obey here.   - Relax Beak-wing," exhorted the new UZMS professor. - It's all right, Beaky. It's okay.   - All right?! - squealed Parkinson, who was leaning over the pale Malfoy at that moment. Although, it was surprising that this 'aristo' could turn even more pale. - Draco is dying!   Hagrid was taken aback, but then he pulled himself together, and not just himself. He lifted Draco, who was whimpering like an abandoned girl, into his arms like a fluff ball. The students were visibly frightened. Everyone except Trio, because they'd seen worse, and Ilya, because... because he's Ilya. That kind of says it all.   - Class dismissed," the woodsman's voice returned instantly to normal in moments of peril or perceived peril. - I'll take Draco to the Hospital, all of you to your living rooms. Ilya, Professor Dumbledore is waiting for you.   The ranger blew his whistle and the hippogriffs began to walk away deep into the forest. As Ilya passed by, the young man stretched out his right arm.   - Welcome to the club," Ilya smiled, hinting that more than one flyer had bled a weakling.   Surprisingly, the hippogriff snorted a little mockingly, winged his arm, and disappeared into the woods. Weasel, with his hands behind his head, staggered barefoot behind the group of joking students. All of them were discussing the scene of the Slytherin's wounding as one. The Paleface Aristo gang, of course, were pissing and shitting themselves, promising the school in general and Hagrid in particular the worst punishments. They were talking about how great everything had turned out, except that Draco hadn't died. Here it was Ronald who was the most zealous, tried to be saddled by the famous pacifist and humanist, Granger.   The weasel, who had tailed Scarlet, was getting close to the three friends. Lavender had managed to build up at least a size two this summer, and Isabelle and Parvati were starting to round up in all the right places, too. But after the Egyptian beach and clubs, Illyadaje didn't need to strain to keep her eyes off of cleavage or short skirts. These girls were no match for the theme girls and ladies.   However, the three girlfriends never got a chance to chat with their mate, as Hermione turned to Illya.   - Where have you been?! - barked the nerd. - The whole school has been looking for you for three days!   - Flattered," Ilya nodded, and as if nothing had happened, he wandered on.   The nerd stayed behind, dazed and stunned by such a statement. Soon she came to her senses and caught up with the young man.   - What do you mean, flattered?   - I'm flattered that...   - You know what I mean! - shouted Danger. - I'm going to tell Mrs. Weasley everything!   - I'm going to go ahead and do it," Ilya shrugged. - I could even put a medal on your chest. I'm amazed, by the way, that it's started to grow on you.   Hermione was taken aback again, but then Ron, who had been listening in on the conversation, got involved.   - Oh, you...   - It wasn't an insult, Red, it was a compliment," Ilya sighed. - Well, maybe not quite a compliment, but a bit of an insult. But you fucked me up...   - I think the summer in Egypt has been a good one. - I see that my summer in Egypt was not in vain.   - Even got a glimpse of Prophet," Lavender interjected, fluttering her eyelashes flirtatiously.   Only Parvati alone remained silent and glanced sideways at Seamus. Ilya squinted slightly, racked his brain for a second, and then picked up on the situation. Most likely one of the twins and Finigan had started 'dating'. In quotes, because they were only thirteen years old. So this whole "dating" thing is highly conventional. More like an agreement to hold hands and only kiss each other.   - And he's done his time," Ronald-something-his-Weasley inserted his five pence with a great deal of schadenfreude.   He must have been pretty pissed off that Brown and McDougal had spotted Ilya in the photo, but not him, Ronald. And how could he be noticed when there were seven other redheads just like him. But really, Weasley was wasting his time. The girls were just enjoying flirting and flirting with the handsome Slytherin, they didn't think much more of it. It was akin to a close dance on the verge of a foul. Just a pleasant pastime, dangerously tickling the nerves.   - Do time? - Isabelle's eyes widened. - Tell me.   - Oh ladies," sighed Ilya theatrically. - Most important advice - don't drink with the Russians. Never. Never. Drink. With Russians.   By this time the students had reached the castle and Weasel had to take his socks out of his pockets and his boots off his neck. But despite the fact that he had his shoes on, he still had nothing to wear on his torso. Ilya did not think long about it, but simply waved and went on.   If the students had managed to change a little over the summer. Who got taller, who got denser, who got fatter, who got fatter, who got prettier, who got pimpered, the castle was strikingly unchanged. It seemed and there were not those three months of sun and fun, because Hogwarts, against the background of growing organisms, was frozen in time a rock. The same atmosphere, the same smell of cloth and stone, the same emotions when looking at paintings and tapestries. The best school of Witchcraft and Sorcery in the world shone with its permanence, and there was a special appeal about it.   But all the beautiful mystery of the ancient stronghold of magic was shattered by the equally mysterious rustling of cloth against old stone. The famous Bat appeared on the horizon, able to arise at precisely the moment no one fucking needed him. Although, if you think about it, then any moment Snape appeared would be exactly that. Because who needs him anyway.   - Mr. Ilya," the potter hissed. - You seem to enjoy putting on a show at the beginning of the year.   - By no means, sir! - the young man resented. - Performances are for actors; in my case it is a concert.   A wave of laughter swept through the crowd, which was immediately silenced by the stare of the school's head bastard.   - It seems that you worked as a stripper over the summer, Mr. Ilya," Snape curved his thin lips in a sneer, alluding to Ilya's semi-nudity. - But Hogwarts is not a nightclub.   - Yes," Ilya stretched out, looked around, and tapped his finger on his chin, as he always did when he thought about it. - I don't see a pylon here. But maybe I'll be able to show my class without it.   And again a wave of laughter, this time more distinct. Snape started to boil, but didn't make it to the explosion as the school bell rang, announcing the end of class.   - Change and march to the Headmaster," Snape muttered through gritted teeth, and turning one hundred and eighty, he himself went to Dumbledore's tower.   - Gentlemen, don't be too fond of me," Ilya sobbed feignedly, and then headed for the dungeons,   whistling the same immortal tune.               Twenty minutes later.               Ilya did not betray himself. He rolled up the sleeves of his school uniform and robe in such a way that he looked like a medieval samurai or a rocker who had recently returned from a concert. And, not surprisingly, the second option was much closer to him.   The gargoyle was in no hurry to show good or even proper manners this time. At first the young man thought of a supposed password, and then slapped his hand on his forehead. He quickly pulled out of his pocket the hat of Pharaoh (well, you didn't think that Ilya forgot about the promise to give the stoner something appropriate, and certainly didn't think that he would leave his trophy to the police). Having placed a simple but ancient crown on the head of the guard, Weasel bowed his head to the side, and then corrected the right edge.   - She's a beauty, I'll give you that. Wear it in good health. It's from Egypt itself.   The gargoyle would have smiled if she could have, but she just moved aside, opening the doorway. Well, now Ilya was bribing, and not just anyone, but magical statues. I wonder if such nuances are included in the resume. Just in case. If you've managed to bribe a stone, you can bribe anyone.   Ilya went up the winding staircase, and then knocked manically on the tall doors. But just as his knuckles touched the carved ornament, the doors swung open, letting the boy into the oval office.   Nothing had changed here, just like in the rest of Hogwarts. On the many shelves, behind the glass, among the crystal vials and vials, were all sorts of devices. Many hissed and snorted, some buzzed and whirled, others made some impossible, almost indistinguishable sounds.   On the walls hung portraits of past principals and headmistresses, who, as usual, did not hiss at the young man, who gave them a jutting middle finger. A table with carved feet in the shape of lion's paws stood by the window. The table, lined with red cloth, was piled with piles of papers and other implements and work stuff. And behind the table, on the largest and most painted cabinet, littered with books and other things, lay an ancient hat, whose song Ilya had again missed. But of course we can't forget the perch with the red phoenix, the first, and most desperate fan of Ilya's music. Although the first one was kind of a white lab mouse, but not the point.   The local "council of elders" was already gathered around the table. Old McGee, all flashing her stern, horn-rimmed glasses and the posture of a queen. Snape, perpetually dissatisfied with everything, by the way, is it possible he has that face because the potter is allergic to all the shampoos in the world? Flitwick, cozily ensconced in a little armchair, seemingly even dozing off. And of course the grandfather of the country, the Great Light Wizard, head of the Wizengamot and just a good-natured, cheerful old man - Albus Dumbledore, who is clutching at his vase with lemon wedges.   Ilya turned his head toward the cupboard and almost fainted, from the amount of security charms of the highest order. Apparently sweets were very important to Albus.   - Shalom, gentlemen of the jury," Ilya nodded.   He made his way to the table and plopped down in the chair that had appeared. Flitwick, at the sound of a falling body, perked up, yawned, rubbed his eyes, and then clapped the Slytherin on the shoulder. The young man nodded at some part of the goblin and, against his will, blurted out a welcoming smile. He probably missed this old man after all, but just a little bit, yes - just a little bit.   - Minus twenty points for rudeness," the transfiguration professor snorted.   Ilya even choked and was immediately slapped on the back by the enchantment teacher.   - Ma'am, either you're anti-Semitic or you have no sense of humor.   - And twenty more," McGonagall smiled predatory, feline-like.   - But...   - Ilya, shut your mouth," Snape hissed. - Otherwise our faculty will lose all their points.   Weasel covered the bread-cutter and went about his every business - he began to poke in. He did not even understand what they wanted from him. So he spent the night in the woods, went out - who doesn't happen? In the end, you could gather the board, if Ilya lost his head from hormones and some pretty and hunted senior girl had a little "Ilya," and perhaps even a few. But Ilya confidently resisted the mind below the belt buckle and remained relatively innocent.   - I see the summer's been rather entertaining, my boy," Dumbledore chipped away mockingly, in his own style, nodding towards the beautiful, obviously musical tattoo on his left arm.   - Oh, is that what you mean? - Ilya waved his hand. - Don't even ask who did it-I keep it a secret under pain of axes of the head.   Flitik grunted, Dumbledore smiled into his beard, Snape muttered an indignant swear word under his breath, and the Iron Lady nearly fainted.   - I see you've already made up your mark," she coined like a steel press.   There was silence in the office, but a silence that was unusual, a kind of harshness.   - Um," Ilya stretched out a confused Ilya. - Actually, the sign was invented by a monk named Guido of Aretha in the year one thousand twenty-four. By the way, he's the muggle who first thought of recording music. But it looks good, doesn't it?   - It's amazing," Dumbledore nodded. - I remember when I was twenty, I wanted to stab a gryphon on a... I was in my twenties, but it didn't really matter.   - Why didn't you?   - I turned out to be allergic to salamander saliva," the headmaster sighed genuinely sad.   - Trouble," said the young man, upset for the old man.   Don't forget that the hat present here now noted that the kid truly has a heart too big, inherited from his mother.   - It's a long time ago," Dumbledore waved his slice. - And I've got a scar under my right knee that matches the pattern of the London Underground Railroad perfectly.   - Whoa! Oh, wow!   - I knew you'd appreciate that, my boy," Albus sparkled his eyes. - But now we're gathered on another, more important, but less interesting matter.   Ilya nodded, letting him know that he was ready for full cooperation and that he had nothing to hide. Except for the fact that the gargoyle now bears the crown of the ancient kings of Egypt, but that's another story.   - Where did you spend those five days, my boy?   - I was in... - the young man began his story, but then stumbled at the half word. He opened his deep, bright blue eyes wide on the dark whites, and even gasped intermittently. - Five days? - With a wheeze he asked. - Are you kidding me?   But, from the looks on their faces, no one was joking. Even Flitwick's eyes were gone from mockery to stern concern. Not to mention McGee, who was as ready to latch onto Ilya's throat as a cat on a captured pigeon. As for Snape, he didn't care, as long as someone's inkblood was spilled and a reprieve was ordered. Natural bastard.   - But... but... but I...   - What is the last thing you remember, my boy? - Now Dumbledore's voice, too, exuded a warm concern.   Ilya began to go over the picture puzzle of the past in his head.   - I remember going out for a smoke...   - for a smoke? - McGonagall blubbered.   - Professor," Flitwick pleaded. - Withdraw your points later, we're discussing a more important matter now.   - But smoking is strictly prohibi...   - Minerva, dear, I have to agree with Filius," Dumbledore interrupted the argument with a wave of his hand. - Please continue, Ilya.   Ilya nodded again and continued:   - So, I went out for a smoke in the vestibule. There I opened the window and noticed that the rain was too slanting, as if we were driving down a slope. Then I was smoking, and thinking about my own things. And then suddenly my cheek got stiff. I looked and there was not rain, but hail. Suddenly it got cold and stank of corpses. I got twisted, I only had time to get my stick. I was in my head, and then I was in my head, and the next thing I knew, I was in my head, and I was in my head.   - Do you know what Dementors are? - Snape interrupted the student.   - I think I can read," the boy shrugged. - I was flipping through a book about these muffins. Anyway, there was, like, two of them, or... no, there were two. One was in the room with Potter and them, and the other one was trying to javelin me. I remember just trying to poke him in the nostril with my wand, Harry style, but there was no nostril, just a gap in his toothless mouth. It was disgusting, like the whole block had been doing a lap on that little dove...   - Mr. Ilya," Flitwick hissed. - You're worrying again, but I admit you're making progress - my ears haven't turned into a tube yet.   - Thank you, Professor," the brunette in the hat replied a little lethargically.   - Is that all, my boy? - Dumbledore asked.   - Yes," Ilya nodded for the third time. - Then darkness. I only woke up in the woods. I was in the woods, though.   - Yes, my boy?   - I was dreaming," Ilya began to feel embarrassed, which somewhat surprised those present.   In their memory, instances of this Slytherin's embarrassment were as rare as a total solar eclipse.   - Ilya, we are not interested in your adolescent erotic dreams, - contemptuously smirked Salty-haired, traditionally propping himself up the closet.   - My pants look the same," Ilya grimaced. - If you were right, they'd have to be replaced.   - I'm not your girlfriend and I don't keep track of your pants.   - I certainly hope so.   - Ilya, my boy," either Potter is playing the part of Dumbledore, or vice versa, it's about time they got into a nascent argument. - Can you tell us what that dream was about?   - Well... - stretched out even a slightly blushing Ilya. - I was dreaming about a girl...   - Ilya, I warned you.   - It's not what you think! - Ilya, who was clutching the armrest to his white knuckles, was suddenly furious without knowing why. - It was a girl with an angelic face, and she was singing to me!   - Did you dream of angels singing? - Dumbledore seemed really surprised.   - No," Weasel cut him off. - It's just like I said. It was just an angelically beautiful girl, and she sang to me in an angelic voice.   - Can you see the differences? - McGonagall asked with obvious mockery.   - Quite substantial! - Dumbledore and Ilya answered together.   - My boy, you've been gone for five days and you've had us worried.   - I'm sorry," he grimaced. - I didn't have any such plans.   - That's why no one will punish you for it," the Headmaster said calmly, ignoring Snape and McGonagall's outrages. - You weren't at the feast, so you don't know the most important news. This year there will be Dementors standing around the perimeter of Hogwarts grounds.   Silence.   - It's not a joke.   - Fuck...   - Mr. Illya," Flitwick coughed.   - O- b-a-l-d-e-t-h," Ilya spelled. - Is this about Zack Black and Comrade Potter?   The director nodded.   - And that's why you stopped looking, because you thought I'd been sneak peed on by a psychotic maniac?   The director nodded again, a little disappointed this time.   - I'm so-so disappointed," Ilya sighed, making the headmaster look ten years older and even droopy. - You'd think some lunatic could take down Ilya from Scary Square.   - Do you think you could do anything against the man who killed thirteen Muggles? - Snape asked with a tone of sarcasm in his voice.   - Sure," Ilya hummed. - For starters, the pretzel didn't have his wand-where would he buy it if everyone wanted a bounty on his head. Secondly, after doing so much time with such guards, he clearly moved his head. Third, he's not much of a rationer in a cramped cell, so he's a real piece of work. All in all, it's like shitting... on the pavement. In half a year or so, I'm going to meet that blocked man and now only the infirm would be afraid of him.   - My boy, you always think logically first," the Great Light Mage said, with a touch of chuckle, raising the corners of his lips.   Ilya spread his hands, indicating that this was the case.   - But I hope you're not going after the reward? - The director immediately switched to a sincerely serious tone.   - If I don't get Black tied up, then no, I won't. I'm going to stay away this year from anything that has a deleterious effect on this beautiful body.   Ilya poked his finger in his chest and smiled broadly, pirate-like. Snape and McGonagall almost simultaneously rolled their eyes.   - Then that's the end of our little meeting. Lemon slice?   - I won't refuse," and Ilya, after grabbing a treat, saluted each and every one with his hat and set off... Well, he was going somewhere, of course.               September 8, 1993 England, Hogwarts                   Ilya managed to show his tattoo almost forty times to everyone who wanted to see it during those two days. He was the only one at school who had such a peculiar ornament, which for some reason caused a great stir. However, that didn't keep him from going to his den, where he performed a few Animagic rituals, as well as studying Numerology and Runes. To the boy's dismay, he successfully missed his first Numerology class while lying in the woods. As it turned out, there were only eight people from the third year to attend these lectures. One from Scarlet - Hermione Granger, three from Slytherin - Greengrass, Nott, Ilya, three from Ravens - the silent Chinese girl Lee, Anthony Goldstein - the blond, always sticking his nose everywhere and Terry Booth, the quiet brown, with a keen sense of justice. And then there's the Hufflepuff girl, Linda Stupefy. As you've already figured out, with a last name like that, you never forget a stunner formula. Linda herself was a real gray mouse, one glance at her and immediately forget she existed.   He was a lot more likely to go to Runes, but the same people from Slytherin, the same people from Scarlet, plus Isabelle, the entire course from Ravens (an exaggeration, of course), and the three with the badger's coat of arms. Ilya didn't really understand why most people needed Runes if they didn't attend Numerology. But it was likely that this science had applications beyond the components of composing new spells. At any rate, the minor runes could be drawn by the hundreds, and used as the weakest of charms. They didn't require any power. I was a bit like a man with a heart.   - Shall we sit together? - Isabelle asked, leaning against Ilya.   Tom had to hold on to the girl's weight, for pushing away was not an option. And MacDougall took advantage of it shamelessly.   - Unless you're using me as a pillow, of course.   - I promise," the Gryffindor girl squinted happily, but Ilya didn't believe her for some reason.   There were a lot of people outside the office in the west wing on the second floor, and they were all waiting for the teacher. Many of them were holding huge dictionaries that would not fit in their school bags. Others had piles of textbooks instead of dictionaries, with various examples and explanations. There was no single textbook for Run and the student's main weapon in the subject was the syllabus, and the primary source of all knowledge was the teacher. So having the best witch in her field at school made the students armed to the teeth, so to speak.   Most surprisingly, since there was no Malfoy or Potter on the horizon, the four-faculty crowd looked quite civil, and no one was in any hurry to bully or stab the others. Even Nott and Greengrass only occasionally glanced at Ilya with mild squeamishness.   With the first echo of the bell, the classroom door opened. As it turned out, Professor Babling was already sitting there, probably minding her own business. The room appeared very spacious, designed in the form of an amphitheater, just like Flitwick's. So Ilya confidently led MacDougall to the extreme row adjacent to the window. A total of fourteen people entered the classroom, which instantly settled in peculiar islands. Hermione was the only one sitting alone in front of the chair, just a few feet away from the teacher.   - She looks good-natured," the mate whispered in Ilya's ear.   The girl had already pulled out her dictionary, an exact copy of which Ilya also armed himself with. He decided to play Bond (he had to have fun somehow) and not to shine his knowledge in two additional areas. And since he could not shine a light on his knowledge, neither could his textbooks, all the fields of which were scribbled with his notes.   And Babling did resemble Sprout in some ways. She was a bit overweight, but this looked nothing short of natural, giving the older woman a friendly charm. On her head she wore her hair in a bouffant style with many bobby pins. On her face she was similarly plump and round, which smoothed out her age wrinkles. On the whole, Babling evoked a positive impression, similar to that of her herbalist colleague.   - He'll eat you for talking, you'll know," Ilya mocked the girl in a feigned voice.   - He's mean," her classmate pouted.   However, the friendly flirting had to end. Batilda rose from her seat and walked over to the blackboard, on which was a simple junior rune, which Ilya had spent exactly nine minutes studying.   - It is a pleasure to welcome those who have chosen to study such a difficult and time-consuming subject as the Ancient Runes," Babling's voice was in keeping with her appearance - soft, but at the same time very deep. - Against the title, we will be taking you through the entire realm of the Runes. I should have known you first, but I've known you a little in the past two years and you know enough about me to know me first. So, Runes. Who's already familiar with the subject?   Only one hand rose above the amphitheater - Danger's hand. Ilya was sure he could tell a lot, too, but he's Bond - he can't, he has to keep hustling.   - Yes, Miss Granger, please.   The nerd stood up, fixing her perpetually disheveled bushy brown hair. Apparently Potter wasn't the only one unfamiliar with the concept of combing it after a hot shower. Hermione, as usual before she answered, coughed a little, reminiscent of Ron, or Ronald reminiscent of her, it was hard to tell.   -Runes," the girl began. - They were the first magic on earth. They were used by Priests, Wizards and Magi to create elemental spells. Despite Muggle misconceptions, the first runes were invented in central Africa, the cradle of humanity.   - Very good, five points," Babbling nodded.   Granger seemed a little discouraged. After all, she'd probably hoped for at least a ten. And this was only a five. But it's one thing to be asked by the dean of your own department or a sympathetic professor, and another to be asked by a professional.   - As Miss Granger pointed out, Muggles also know about runes and what Muggles consider their mystical properties. Who can tell me what those runes are? Perhaps you, Mr. Ilya?   Ilya did not immediately understand that he was being addressed, and when he did, he took off his hat and stood up and answered.   - The Futhark runes, ma'am.   - Absolutely right, one point. I'll give you more if you tell me how many Runes are currently known to mages.   - Elder and Junior? - Ilya asked mechanically, and then mentally punched himself in the jaw. He was a lousy Bond, Miss Moneypenny certainly didn't approve.   - Exactly.   - One thousand one hundred and forty-seven, then.   - (chuckles) Great. Three points for the entire answer. Sit down, Mr. Ilya.   Ilya landed on his heel and returned his hat to its proper place. Ilya noticed the way Granger glared in his direction, announcing the season of point competition open. Ilya, as before, didn't give a damn about these competitions. He'd held the title of Best Student for two years now, and no amount of cramming by a crammer would throw him off the podium.   Weasel turned toward the window, but as he turned away, he pinched his arm. There, in the clearing, walked the Trio. The Trio, staying in full force. Ilya looked at Granger sitting in the classroom, then at Granger walking through the clearing, then again, at the one in the classroom, then at the one knocking on the door of Hagrid's hut, and then... then Ilya squeezed his eyes shut and mentally counted to ten. No, this year would pass without any mystery or trouble. This year Ilya would be the most exemplary student whose goal was solely to learn and have fun and nothing else. No secrets, period.   Having finished the self-convincing session, Ilya returned mindfully to his studies.   - Now you are looking at a rune, the Groundsman, a rudimentary rune of old Alvaphite, the use of which will replace the rudimentary lock-locking enchantments. I see you have Herr Stein's dictionaries and Mr. MacDonald's interpreters. For those with dictionaries, the rune is on page seven, in the interpreters, on page three.   Ilya obediently opened the right page, although he could draw Zemets with his eyes closed, hung-over, left hand. However, Ilya was equally proficient with both hands, so the last nuance slightly fell out of the overall picture, but not the point.   - It takes an average mage about a week to learn the first rune, and a more predisposed mage about four days. I will be able to see you on the 15th of the month of the month, as a result of these statistics.   Ilya, after this speech, fell into such a sludge that he even managed to get to the bottom. And when you get to the bottom, it's time to throw out the old paradigm of being and replace it with a new one. But where to take this new paradigm, no one is your adviser. Ilya's hand went up by itself.   - Yes, Mr. Ilya?   - Ma'am, may I ask, when do we move on to the study of the Elder Runes?   - The Elder Runes are an elective in the seventh year for the most accomplished students. Such laden runes are usually too difficult for the human mind, and the rare mage can master at least a few Elder Runes. Did I answer your question?   - Quite, thank you.   - Then let's get on with it.   Ilya slowly burrowed under the bottom of the draft as the world went off its axis and spun in a wild jig. Such an expert simply cannot be wrong, but then it turns out that Pronyra is a genius, and we know very well that he is not. But then how did he manage to master the entire Junior Alphabet and learn one Senior Rune by the time he was fourteen? Perhaps...   No, no, no, no assumptions and theories! This year is declared free of any mysteries. Ilya activated the self-writing pen, won in a fair bet from a driven fanatic, and began to take notes on the lecture. Despite the fact that much Ilya already knew, but Babling was revealing more and more subtleties that only a professional of the highest level could know. The lecture was really entertaining.                  Sixty centimeters of outline and a quarter of an hour later                       - What did you think of Ilya's summer in Egypt? - I'm sure he's ready to kiss Weasley's feet for that kind of generosity. - He's probably ready to kiss Weasley's feet for that kind of generosity, isn't he?   Slytherin and Gryffindor, who traditionally had most classes in pairs, were standing in front of the ZoT class. Admittedly, Weasel was a little wary. After last year, when he had attended this class only for tests and quizzes, Ilya was very skeptical about the possibility of attending these lectures again. However, perhaps the new teacher will refresh and resuscitate almost dead subject, which for the whole year was taught by the most usual charlatan.   - Isabelle, what do you think of the runes? - Ilya turned to his three friends, who had finally stopped staring at the tattoo.   - Very difficult," the girl answered honestly. - I thought it would be easier. But it's certainly better than the Predictions.   - Hey, Ilya, someone's talking to you," Nott said.   - You're wrong! - Patil and Brown exclaimed together.   - Professor Trelawney is a very good professional and profound person," Lavender objected, crossing her arms under her considerable, for her age, breasts.   -Ilya, your mother...   Ilya turned sharply towards Nott, the iron blade of his broadsword showing from the pocket of his robes.   -Are you sure you want to finish that sentence? - almost growled at Ilya.   His response was only silence. The vultures turned around at the noise, and Granger was probably already about to cause order and inflict calm.   - I thought so," Ilya snorted, taking the butterfly away and giving it a nice puff. - Gentlemen of my classmates, let's dot the i's and cross the t's. This year's boy is a darling Ilya. And I'm a darling, right?   - Of course he is," Lavender and Isabelle nodded. Parvati looked toward Seamus again.   - So, nice guy Ilya cuts back on his association with the Slytherin faculty, to training and Quidditch matches. Going for such a serious sacrifice that literally chokes me with hot tears of regret, in the name of world peace. Peace, brothers!   - Where were we? - McDougal tugged at Ilya's robe. - Ah yes, Trelawney. Well, your Trelawney is a maniac.   - And why is that? - Patil and Brown pouted.   - Because rumor has it, she's in every class she takes a death sentence for someone. I'm sure she did, too, in yours.   The girls had nothing to say to that, so they were forced to remain silent.   - I see I've guessed. And who has the honor of being prejudiced?   - To Potter," Patil whispered softly.   Ilya's mind immediately clicked and he raised his voice.   - Ladies and gentlemen, the great prophetess Sybilla Trelawney has prophesied our Harry Potter's imminent death! In connection with this, the Gemini enterprise, in conjunction with Ilya Illya's information office, is opening a sweepstakes. You can find out about the betting in the evening from any Gemini representative. Bets will be accepted until the last exam of the summer session!   At first people started laughing, but then they realized that Ilya was in no way joking. And Ilya was already thinking how he and Fred and George were going to split the profits, and he had to bring them up to speed. As already said, the orphan boy was spinning and twirling in Hog as best he could. He was always running about, deciding and doing something to get a nourishing piece of pie and a warm bed under his mortal body.   - How can you bet on that? - Granger shouted.   Ilya snapped his fingers and answered:   - There you go.   Hermione was probably about to wet something like that, but then Peeves came on the scene. Unlike the other ghosts, he didn't just hate Ilya, he was always in a hurry to do something bad to the Slytherin. He didn't touch the rest of the Greens, for fear of Baron's wrath, but the ectoplasmic gray cardinal apparently gave up his goodness on Ilya.   The poltergeist glided over a group of students, and then literally shot out fresh gum. The gum hit my hat, and I had to struggle to get it out and clean the headgear. But Ilya, with catlike grace and reaction, moved aside, and the gum hit the keyhole, blocking it up.   Ilya immediately stretched out his right hand and showed Peeves a bulging middle finger. The poltergeist pulled out another projectile, but then it sounded:   - Vidivasi!   There was a loud pop, and the gum whistled out of the keyhole, hitting Peeves right in the eye a moment later. Surprisingly, the ectoplasmic howled in pain and scurried away through the wall.   - Excellent spell, always works against pranksters," said the cheerful Lupin, looking much better than he had the week before on the train. - Your way isn't bad either, though.   - Thank you, sir. The middle finger is everything.   The professor hummed and opened the classroom door, into which a flood of students rushed at a moment's notice. Ilya cocked his head warily before entering, and then everyone walked in. The classroom looked as it should. There were portraits of truly famous martial artists everywhere, as well as pictures of the effects of various curses.   The skeleton of a rather diminutive dragon, the Chinese Fireball, hung under the ceiling, a high ceiling stretching almost seven meters upwards. And the loosely spaced desks seemed to be just islands of something mundane, amidst the genuine darkness and horrors of magic. Pictures of curses alternated with images of dangerous creatures, and at times a skull or even a whole skeleton was visible. That sort of thing never appealed to Ilya, but he figured the atmosphere always had to match the subject matter. And certainly pink curtains and the like were no match for the Defense Against the Dark Arts.   - Put your bags on your desks and pick up your wands," Lupin said, a little mysteriously, like a gypsy at a fair. - You won't be needing quills and textbooks today.   - "This is already interesting," thought Ilya, leaving his bag on the desk.    Thankfully, his paranoia had subsided a little, and he wasn't as worried about his little girl anymore. He was now leaving her often in Flitwick's private office.   The people left their junk bags, exposed their wands, and piled up in front of Lupin, faculty-gendered. The new lecturer was a tall man, just past his "prime," about thirty-five years old. His face was extremely intelligent, as were his deep gray eyes, but premature wrinkles were visible, and gray strands in his once black hair. He was dressed in simple, shabby clothes, patched in places, worn in places, and in general he looked little better than Ilya. But when had Ilya ever cared about his professors' clothes?   Behind his back was a huge wardrobe, which occasionally rattled with wobbly knobs and creaky, unlubricated hinges. At times there were mysterious howls from the depths of the closet, and acrid black smoke billowed from the crevices.   - So, has anyone guessed what kind of creature I have in store for you today?   Oddly enough, quite a few hands went up, but asked all the same...   - Miss Granger.   - It's a boggart, sir.   - Absolutely right! Ten points to Gryffindor," Lupin was frankly pleased not only with the correct answer, but also with the opportunity to accrue points. Ilya seemed to already know which department this man was in. - It really is a boggart, I caught him yesterday in the kitchen. What is a boggart, oh, they are relative harmless but quite dangerous creatures. Dangerous in that they can easily throw you off balance. Once you see a boggart, it assumes the guise of your deepest, most secretive, and most terrifying fears. And to meet with such, sometimes not even an experienced mage is not ready. But even against such beings it is possible to fight. All you need to do is imagine your fear in its most comical form and clearly pronounce it - Riddiculus, while depicting here such a flap. Let's all do it together and with a flourish, repeat the formula.   The flick really was just that, an unfinished figure eight to be exact.   - Riddiculus! - with a chorus of nearly twenty people shouted.   - Excellent, just excellent! - Yes, Lupin was really enjoying teaching. - Then I guess we shouldn't put it off too long. Do you have a volunteer?   There were no volunteers, Harry was discussing something with his sidekick and so he didn't hear the offer to go to the front row, or else he would. Rest assured, he did.   - Then how about you? Aren't you Alice and Frank Longbottom's son?   Neville nodded fearfully and took a step forward.   - Sir, you shouldn't summon Longbottom if you don't want to call Pomfrey later! - Malfoy bellowed, and the rest of the group broke into a desperate cackle.   - I'm glad you care so much about your classmate," Lupin replied calmly. - But I think he'll do just fine.   The professor clapped the good-natured chubby boy on the shoulder cheerfully, but it clearly didn't do him much good. Neville clutched his wand frantically and stared wide-eyed at the shaking cabinet.   - So, Neville, what's your biggest fear?   - Pfsrsnp.   - Sorry, I didn't make it out," Lupin exhorted.   Longbottom squeezed his eyes shut, caught his breath, and spoke clearly:   - Professor Snape. I'm afraid, Professor Snape.   A wave of laughter erupted through the classroom, the green ones being the hardest hit, but there were desperate jibes among the vultures as well.   - Well, no wonder he's hard not to be afraid," Lupin smiled good-naturedly and winked at Neville. - But you wouldn't miss an opportunity to present your fear in a funny way.   Longbottom at first didn't understand what Lupin (who apparently knew a lot about humor and banter) was hinting at, but then nodded his head a little hesitantly.   - On the count of three, I open. Get ready Neville," Lupin stepped back to the magic thunderclap that could play with the volume of a concert set. - One! Two! Three!    The preacher waved his obviously willowy wand and the cabinet doors opened. At the same instant, out of the clouds of darkness appeared... Professor Snape in his black, flowing robe. He staggered almost mechanically toward the trembling Neve, extending his first, cupped hand as if he wanted to strangle the boy.   - A spell, Neville! - Lupin shouted, holding his wand at the ready.   - Rid-dic-culus! - Longbottom stumbled twice in the formula, and it didn't work. But then the Gryffindor had panted, stood for a moment, and then said the formula clearly.   With a wave of his wand, a clap sounded, and Snape turned into... "Snape." Instead of a robe, he wore a short fur coat that would fit any nightstalker, bright red high-heeled shoes on his feet, fishnet tights and a dangerous miniskirt above. The neck was adorned with an ancient jabot that had seen more than one kind, and on her head was a pink hat with feathers.   Everyone was silent at first, but then there was thunderous laughter among the vultures. Everyone laughed. Laughing, choking back tears. Lupin, too, coughed frantically, trying to keep his laughter at bay. Ilya squatted down, arms around his stomach, gasping with laughter.   - You are the best Nev! - He was in the middle of the night, and he was in the middle of the night.   Neville smiled tautly and staggered back, and everyone felt obliged to clap him on the shoulder.   - All right, come on, who's next, hurry up before he hides!   The students immediately, still chuckling, lined up. Lupin lowered the gramophone needle, and Ilya closed his eyes slightly, enjoying the immortal classic. This tune was impossible not to recognize. "JailhouseRock" from the old Elvis blew up this class. Boggart began to twinkle like a light bulb on a Christmas garland.    Here Isabelle stepped forward and with a clap of "Snape" turned into a howling flying skull with glowing eye sockets. A spell was cast, and the skull transformed into a... a skull that glowed with candles instead of eye sockets. There was another burst of laughter and another flicker of boggart.   Then it was Milicent's turn, whose pie became a giant bulldog who suddenly had a pink dress. Then there were giant snakes that suddenly lost their teeth, spider monsters tap-dancing, zombies hoarse from howling, under-bed monsters frightened by the lack of a bed, a broken broom that turned into an airplane-some-smog. And everywhere there was laughter, blending in with the music of the deceased Croel Rock. Finally it was Ilya's turn, with Potter behind him.   To make sure the boggart didn't disappear, Lupin had him cornered in the closet for a while. But then the teacher waved his wand, and the weasel, who'd been doing the real twist the whole time, froze. Elvis was still singing about the prison party, and suddenly the closet was shifting. There was a muffled howl, a creaking of bones and the rustle of rotten leaves, a darkness and even a shuddering of the lamp. Blackening fog lay across the floor, a chill enveloping everyone present, and the girls huddled together. The boys clenched their teeth. A moment later, out of the closet... half an apple rolled out of the cabinet.   - Fucking hell! - Ilya exclaimed, pointing his wand at his greatest fear in life. - Die Riddiculus abomination!   The apple got legs, arms, a dress, and started can-can-dancing. Lupin chuckled and chased the boggart into the closet.   - Are you afraid of half an apple, Mr. Ilya? - the professor wondered.   - I'm afraid of the half of what was in the half of the apple!   - I don't get it...   - It was half a worm! - exclaimed Ilya, trembling with disgust. - Half a fucking worm! I can't eat apples after that incident!   Almost everyone was lying there laughing now. And Lupin, unable to contain his laughter, gestured to Harry. With a flick of his wand, he opened the cabinet doors, then suddenly looked up at Potter with a startled look. Only a puff of smoke managed to pull out of the closet before the professor stepped between Glasses and Boggart. A clap and a voluminous silver orb glistened over the hall, another clap and the orb turned into a deflated yellow ball, which flew with a grunt into the wardrobe. With another wave of his wand, Lupin locked the boggart with magic locks.   - Bom! Bom!" the bell rang.   - That was a good one," Lupin said, drowning out the music. - Everyone who defeated the boggart - ten points. Mr. Potter and Miss Granger - fifteen points.   The students, still impressed by the lesson, began to leave the room and head to the Great Hall for lunch. And all the while Ilya was reflecting on the fact that this was probably the best ZoT lesson of his life. In fact, a professor who knows a lot about music might be the best teacher since Flivetwick. Yeah, it sounds like it's going to be a great year.   Ilya blew hotly into Isabelle's ear, and, dodging her fist, tossed his bag and raced toward the stairs - he was terribly hungry, but not even a hundred Dementors and Dark Lords would make him eat apples, such fears could not be overcome.  Chapter 25      October 12, 1993 England, Hovagarts                   Ilya stretched his legs and lit a cigarette. Things were going pretty well so far. No throngs of Dementors burst into the castle, hungry for the souls of underage and not-so-underage mages. No maniacs were after Potter's, and not only Potter's, warm flesh.  And it was quiet all around.   In class, Ilya answered exclusively with a positively high score as usual, and for his written work, he never received a grade lower than "P". One time Snape tried to overturn him. Draco, the little twerp, because of his "extremely serious" injury pretended to be a broom. Like he couldn't even eat on his own - Parkinson was spoon-feeding, a gut-wrenching sight to be honest. The worst thing is that he can't even play Quidditch properly - Madam Hook had to rearrange the timetable for him because Malfoy Senior was just as bound up as Snape, and people had forgotten that Slytherin had a spare catcher. So he had to cut the ingredients on potions as well.    At first, the Half-Haired Man wanted to give such an honorable position to Ilya, and even made some sort of creeping move in that direction. Except when, for some unknown reason, Malfoy's cauldron exploded, scalding the blonde's face, the Bastard removed Ilya from that high position, replacing him with Potter.    That was the end of the misadventures in Potions - the respirator and earplugs were doing a fine job this year as well.   In the case of ZoT, it was exactly as Weasel had hoped. Professor Lupin turned out to be a really powerful man. For one thing, he always knew how to poke fun at me in a way that made me want to burrow under the ground and sit there for at least eternity. But he also knew his subject matter perfectly. This year the third year had two topics: dark creatures and methods of confronting them, and the fight against malignant curses. And in both these subjects, the professor felt like a fish in water and was able to tell such things, which would not be written in the textbook. All in all, it was great.   It had become more boring in spells lately, but not because of the esteemed Professor Flitwick, but simply because Ilya had escaped to the fifth year in that area. Although for some part the goblin had recently become less likely to make a colorful spectacle out of the lesson and more and more likely to freeze at the half-word, and then cough hoarsely. At evening classes, the master of spells assured Ilya that it would soon pass, he just caught a magic cold in the summer, so he can't get it out.    The herbalism and Astronomy went on as before - Ilya was studying and trying to remember something at least. The Elder Runes, the giant equations of Numerology, the rituals of Animagic, and everything else was just out of place in Ilya's mind.    This nuance was most pronounced in Transfiguration. This semester, overtaking the programs by almost half a year, the third year of Slytherin and Gryffindor began to pass the transmutation of living into living. It would seem that after two years of animagogy lessons weasel should have been shrewd on the subject, but because of the chronic lack of sleep, constant physical, magical and mental exercises, Ilya began to fall out of reality frequently. So it happened on one test work, where it was necessary to turn a beetle into a butterfly. Then Ilya almost got the first "B", but in time to correct his mutant mosquito on a swallowtail, McGee did not notice the mistake and did not withdraw the point. Granger, on the other hand, had, for once, decided not to pawn anyone off. Actually, it wasn't because the girl had been awakened to notions, but because she, too, was starting to turn in. So, to be reasonable, the third year was indeed the most difficult and crucial.   But still Ilya had time for fooling around, for light pranks with clock bombs and what he had managed to steal from the Twins over the summer. The faculty lounges, in which guitar tunes were played regularly, were not neglected either. True, more often Ilya began to notice that the high school girls, using him instead of a plush toy, began to press very different parts of the body, hotter and languid breathing, and generally somehow changed everything a little. Ilya had a reasonable fear that if things continued this way, he would be raped by a mob of witches.   Not that Ilya was not visited by characteristic dreams, and he did not find characteristic spots in the morning, but every action had its consequences. And any possible consequences of such an action were exceptionally unnecessary to Weasel at the moment. Oh, and he was only fourteen years old. No, of course the elders in the orphanage often dispersed on such topics, but it was more like a tale. So weasel decided to wait another year or even a year and a half before he was introduced to such pleasures of life.    - How long have you been waiting? - A familiar voice sounded, blending in with the creak of the door hinge.   Ilya extinguished his cigarette, tossed the cigarette butt into the far corner of the abandoned office, and looked at his watch. It was five minutes to nine.    - No," the Slytherin shook his head and jumped down from the windowsill. - How did you get here?   - I'm sure he'll be fine," Fred shrugged as he followed his brother out the door. - I've been looking for them for a long time.   George pushed Creevey and Longbottom forward. The photographer was literally glowing with excitement and anticipation for the adventure, but Neville was clearly apprehensive. He trembled, glancing toward the door as if it were his salvation.   - Now that we're all set...   - ... I think you can...   - ... start.   - Nev, do you remember your task? - Ilya asked, turning to his classmate.   Longbottom nodded his head and pursed his lips, breathing deeply. It was his way of calming himself down. Neville couldn't be called a daredevil, but he couldn't be called a coward either, because the chubby boy always knew how to overcome his fears.   - Reporter?   - It's gonna be okay!   Ilya glanced at the twins, who shrugged.    - Okay, then I'll open it.   Weasel stepped away from the group of his companions and, tugging on the rope, unlatched the old, musty chest. Immediately black smoke puffed from the depths of this antiquity, a mysterious howl rang in the ears, and a moment later Professor Snape appeared in the light. This time, too, he held out his right hand and staggered mechanically toward Neville.   - Nev, burn! - Fred shouted, taking his position.   Actually, George and Ilya pointed their wands at the boggart and took their places as well, forming something like a triangle, with the illusory Snape as the center.   - Riddiculus! &shy;&shy;" Longbottom said clearly.   There was a clap and Snape was once again dressed in a very revealing outfit with the unwavering jabot.    - Ilya, we're out! - George commanded.   The Weasleys raised their wands at the same time as Ilya and the three of them barked:   - Filopupa!   The trio's wands released slightly translucent threads. Some were wrapped around the boggart's legs, some around his arms, some around his neck and waist, some around his fingers and even his tongue. In all, there were ten threads from each wand, each of which found its target.   - My turn," Creevey bit his tongue anticipatorily as he clicked off the first frame.   - Let's add some jazz, boys! - Ilya smirked.   After that suggestion, the boggart as Snape began to assume the most "seductive" and "intimate poses." Actually, that's exactly what they would have been if instead of Snape, the boggart had turned into a stunning beauty from Wizarding Girls magazine. But that's who you have to be to be afraid of pretty girls...    And Colin kept clicking the shutter, leaving frame after frame on the film. Snape kept twirling and turning, Neville was holding a transformation spell, and Gemini and Weasel were gasping with barely contained laughter. At some point, all five of them erupted. The spells were gone, and the five students were lying on the floor, banging their fists against the ancient stone. Their thunderous laughter made the ceiling shake, made the walls shake. Boggart vanished with a resounding bang, disintegrating into the black smoke.   Ilya's laughter was a croak, and he was frantically trying to breathe, wrapping his arms around his stomach. Colin sobbed silently, occasionally hiccuping and writhing in pain after such hysteria. The twins tapped each other on the back and gave a thumbs up. And Longbottom still couldn't move and was literally rolling around on the floor.   The boys had been gone for about five minutes before they all sat in a circle, with their backs to each other. The children had enough time for about five more minutes, and then they all sat in a circle, with their backs to each other.    At times one of them would chuckle, and this would cause them all to fall back into an uncontrollable agony of laughter. After that, they would groan and cackle and wipe away their tears again. You could say the evening was a success.   - A frame for every pose? - Weasel wheezed.   - How... and... We-we-agreed," Colin pushed through with difficulty, still holding the camera in his hand.   - We'll share...   - ... fair or...   - ... evenly?   There was silence for a moment, and then another burst of laughter erupted. In the end the people only calmed down after a couple of minutes, when the cries were no longer from laughter, but from pain in the stomach and lungs.    - Shall we vote? - Nev suggested.   - Who's for even?    Five hands went up in the air at once. No one wanted to bother with "fair".    - Unanimous," Ilya summed up. - Then twenty percent per brother.   - How much will we sell it for?   - Half a galleon for the shot," Fred shrugged, still holding his stomach.   - It seems expensive," Ilya stretched out, suspecting that no one would buy at such a price.   - Don't worry, Ilya," George said. - They'll sell out in a heartbeat.    - How are the stakes, by the way? - Ilya suddenly inquired.    He had a fifth in the sweepstakes, too, and eighty percent went to the Twins. The division was because Illya had the idea and the promotion, and Weasley had all the risks and everything. In general, in this case, everything was fair.    - There's already some...   - ... after the holidays...   - ... it's going uphill.   They were quiet for a while, trying to catch their breath and calm their frayed nerves. The operation, code-named "The Boiler on the Panel," took the three marginalists and their two accomplices about an hour. Most of the time was spent laughing and resting afterwards.   - Shall we split up? - Ilya asked.   - Yes, you can...   - ... Filch in second, the rest...   - ... on duty, too, far away.   - I've always wondered," Weasel said with a grunt, getting to his feet. - How do you know who's where in the castle?   - You'll know a lot," Fred clapped Ilya on the right shoulder.   - You won't sleep well," George slapped Weasel on his left.                  18 October 1993 England, Hovagrts                           The match schedule has undergone a major change, and while last year the first came in early November, this year it's mid-October. The reasons for the change we already knew-the Dementors and the hand of Malfoy. Which of those two extremes was more abominable, Weasel didn't know. Still, he grimaced as he made his way to the bleachers.   - Ilya, are you sure you're coming with us? - Isabelle asked.   Ilya, as always, walked along with his companions. Patil was spending more and more time with Seamus, but she was beginning to get tired of it. Teenagers are like that - very fickle.   - It's not like they're playing against Slytherin," he shrugged. - I could cheer for the Gryffs, too.    - I'm not going to let it go like that," she said, her head shaking. - I'm not going to let Malfoy get away with this.   - I've got something to nail him with," Weasel grinned predatory.   A merry flock of serpentine sophomores ran past, and among them Ilya noticed the exuberant head of Astoria Greengrass. Astoria, like her sister, was unusually beautiful. Except that while Daphne was a true blonde, her sister was known as a fiery brunette. Put these two beauties side by side and you could paint a picture of Yin and Yang. They were so different in their "coloring" and identical in their stunning beauty.    - By the way, it's a little too quiet this year," MacDougall chuckled.    Ilya had long been annoyed by these giggles, but he kept a low profile so as not to offend anyone.   - Yeah, the castle's gotten pretty boring," Lavender said in agreement.   - I'm no jester," muttered a slightly offended Ilya. - But as of tomorrow, I guarantee a lot of fun.   - How exciting! - Isabelle was so excited. - Tell me!   Ilya grinned mentally. He wasn't really going to tell them that Creevey was going to finish developing the film tonight, and that tomorrow they were going to start selling the pictures underground.    - Hang in there and you'll find out.   - Yuck, that's boring.   - It's seasonal for me. I always get moody by winter.   - How about warming you up? - She winked and wiggled her shoulder, fluttering her eyelashes.   - I don't want to be accused of arson," Ilya countered instantly.   It is unlikely that MacDougall was really prepared to take any action following such a transparent hint, but you must not leave things unsaid in such conversations. If it does happen, either the girl will think that you are complexed or shy, or she will make up her own unknown mind. If you ask where he knows, he will answer this - the books. Weasel has learned a lot about life in general from books.    The stadium loomed up ahead, but at that moment the black clouds that covered the sky finally opened their flaps and a real downpour poured down on the ground. Weasel took a long, classic umbrella out of his bag and opened it over his friends. Patil, however, snuck under exactly the same umbrella to Seamus, whose sidekick, Dean, manically stepped aside and walked alone.   Isabelle and Lavender snuggled up to the weasel. Not so much for any intimate reasons, but just to keep from getting wet. Ridiculously, the two girls' bodies did warm Ilya, but it was more simple physics than fanciful metaphysics. Ilya did not and did not want to think about serious or not-so-serious relationships. He simply did not have time for them, and there was no desire for them. The weasel felt quite comfortable alone with his own thoughts, affairs, and plans.   A considerable line had already gathered near the stadium at the booth. The birds probably had no idea why a huge river of black and sometimes colorful umbrella mushrooms suddenly bloomed on the ground. And the answer was quite simple - tickets. Really, you didn't think watching a Quidditch match at school was free, did you? No, of course the price was quite symbolic, only a pound and a half, but there it was nonetheless.    Climbing the steep, rain swollen, dirty and slippery wooden steps, Ilya found himself in the Gryffindor sector. The place was already crowded, and heavy, murky streams of typically British-smelling, freezing rain streamed down the edges of umbrellas. Many wore special water-repellent goggles over their eyes to comfortably follow the match. Others used special charms, but Ilene required neither. He could see perfectly, despite the wall of rain, as if abstracted from the slashing drops.    Ilya took a scarlet scarf from the hands of some do-gooder, wrapped it around him, and sat down on the skywalk, holding an umbrella over his head. Isabelle, Lavender, and whoever else had enough room to sit under the black dome.    However, although the stadium was literally drenched in rain, the students were still going wild, shouting counting, shouting and other vocal paraphernalia of sporting events. But then Madame Hooch showed up on the field, limboing the chest where the magic balls were encased. Two bludgers, a quaffle, and a little golden asshole - a snitch.    - Miss me?! - the familiar voice of the commentator blaring across the field. - Here I am, Lee Jordan, your faithful commentator! Let's make some noise!   The stands cheered and stomped, because there was no way to clap. Ilya shouted and stomped along with everyone else. After all, the point is to watch the match live if you can't afford such joys.   - As we know," Lee continued. - Malfoy has a boo-boo with his knob, so today against the valiant Gryffindor, the equally valiant Hufflepuff will take the field! Let's welcome our gladiators of the broom and the ball!   There was even more cheering, shouting and stomping. It even seemed as if the stands were one howling, shouting and stomping organism, trembling under the hypnotic cries of the commentator.   Down there, on a field that looked like one brown, flowing slurry, fourteen men emerged, among whom a ruffled black hair and shiny glasses were instantly recognizable.   - Speaking from Gryffindor today is our captain and goalkeeper who is graduating this year - Oliver Wood! I think I've had too much to drink, because I see two single Chasers. Oh, no! It's our Twins! Oh, my God, someone stole my heart and ripped it into three pieces. Our three stunning beauties with sticks between their legs... So, the Chasers are Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet! And, of course, let's welcome our perpetual catcher - Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy!   The crowd was buzzing and shouting. Two faculties - Ravenclaw and Gryffindor something uplifting and encouraging. Badgers - light and a little offensive, but Slytherin rushed to mix the team in general and Potter in particular with mud. But their cries were often overpowered by those of the others.    - On the Hufflepuff side, up in the air will be: the goalkeeper who can score you a goal with one kick across the field - Ilya Fleet! The runners-up - the lightning-quick Anthony Rickett, and, it's no secret - the stick-knowledgeable...   - The microphone, Jordan, give me that micro...   - I apologize for the slight interference on the line! Second Runner-up, Maxim O'Flaherty! The runners-up, the charming Heidi McAvoy, whose flight, for obvious reasons, can be watched forever. Not once missed the milk all last season - Malcolm Preece, and of course, my adored goddess - Tamsin Appleby. Love you, baby! Hands off the mic!    Digori was one of the most popular guys in the school, so it was no surprise that he was greeted very, very eagerly. The squeals and squeals of the female section of the stadium were especially audible. Isabelle and Lavender were cheering along with everyone else, and Weasel even ducked a little in both ears. He felt as if there were not two girls sitting next to each other, but two insistent mosquitoes.    But at last the first whistle blew and the fourteen took to the sky. Madam Hooch pointed her wand at the chest.   - And here was the referee putting the balls in play! - Jordan, who had risen from his seat and put his foot on the pulpit, sounded like an army captain before a fight. - Snitch immediately disappeared in the rain and mist, and the quaffle was intercepted by Spineth!   Alicia, brown ball in hand, dodged a well-aimed bludger and raced toward the badgers' goal. Spinet always had mad speed, but she often lost out on maneuvers, especially in the vertical.   - Tamsin rushes in, come on sweetie, come on and oooh yes! Appleby knocks the quaffle out of Spinet's hands, but Bell picks it up in a flash. Sorry, sweetheart, but our Furies play better!    - Jordan, this is the last time I'm gonna...   Katie, taking possession of the ball, ducked under the effeminate Flaherty, and was almost close to the badger rings. But she ran into Preece, who flew in just in time. There was no chance to hit the basket from such a position - Ilya knew that.   - And Bell passes to Johnson! But the quaffle falls from the sky and McAvoy, look at those... ahem... who's gonna go first?! And, oh devil and holy macaroni! George Weasley, and don't even ask me how I identified him, mistook a quaffle for a bludger!   Despite what Lee said, Forge deliberately slammed the bat into another ball. Weasel knew it was a technique Vulture had been practicing in training for a couple of weeks. How - connections, rumours, deduction, observation and all that.    Quoffle darted toward the goal, and was intercepted just inside the line by Bell, who was still in her seat. And with a slight laziness she tossed him toward the goal.    - What a feint! Fleet falls to the bottom left, but because of the rain, he can't see it's a twist! Bell hits the top and the score becomes 10-0 in favor of Gryffindor! It's the first goal of the season for the Lions!   The stands exploded with shouts and applause. Traditionally, the first goal of the season was supported by the whole school. Although, as you might have guessed, this tradition was followed by everyone except the Greens. They could not afford to applaud in honor of the "enemy" faculty - fools, I will say nothing. But Ilya was busting his balls as much as he could. He loved not only playing Quidditch, but also watching this wonderful sport. These battles under the dome of the sky, at insane speeds on all planes, were far more tempting than any Mugglewolf sport with a sword.    - But what is it?! Oh, yes, gentlemen, our Trappers have spotted the Snitch! As Spinnet and McAvoy battle for the quaffle, Potter and Digory go for a vertical dive. They get lost in the rain, but seem to be going for a flush! Who... kh... psh... them... kha... ssh... maet...   Jordan seemed to be having trouble with the microphone. It hissed and hissed and barely spit. Suddenly, the screams, the laughter, the screeching, the stomping in the stadium died down. It was as if they were frozen in jelly, unable to get through. The wind became much colder and even more piercing, as if it were penetrating my heart, clamping it in an icy vice.    Instead of the wet echo of large drops, Ilya heard the measured crackle of shattering ice flakes. Suddenly it was as if all the joy, all the celebration of the first match of the season was pulled out of the atmosphere. Floating figures in black cloaks began to appear on the edges of the stadium. Shouts, sobs, and groans were heard.   Ilya didn't understand why it was so crowded at first, but then he realized that MacDougall and Brown were huddled against him, as if looking to his friend for protection. Except that Weasel himself was utterly helpless. He was drawn deeper and deeper into the maelstrom of fear and despair, where no corner shone with the glow of joy and happiness.   Through the faded veil, Ilya could see the circle of Dementors swirling, funneling into the sky, toward the players. But the maelstrom, like a greedy abyss, was sucking itself in. There Ilya heard a woman's laughter, a terrible laugh, full of madness and insidious pleasure. The laughter, from which the prince pressed himself into a corner, trying to find the spear and pitchfork of the freak, while the freak on the contrary - clenched his teeth in a steel lock and scrambled in the darkness, looking for a poisoned sting, in order to shove it down the throat of who belongs to this hellish cackle.   I don't know why, and with trembling hands I reached into his robe pocket and pulled out his lighter, almost dropping it. The darkness was approaching with the inexorability of a rushing train. And the greedy fangs of the blackness glinted like the drawn blade of an executioner's axe.    - Click, click," Silicon coughed.   - "Swear..." - sounded somewhere deep in my head.   The colors were so faded that it felt like watching a black-and-white movie. It was getting harder to breathe, and sweat trickled down my back and forehead. Isabelle shuddered and cried, and Brown bit her lip bloodily, squeezing so hard she could have broken the bones in her eye sockets.   - Click, click," came the flint again, still not lighting the fuse.   - "I swear..."  - and then another attack of that laughter.    - Click," the flint coughed one last time, and the flame of the lighter soared a good twenty centimeters upward. Ilya gazed into the red strands of orange dancing, and the fear receded. The prince turned his shoulders and reached for the fire, as if wanting to draw his strongest weapon from the dance of chaos.   - "I lied - Crucio," Ilya heard as if through a veil, and the feeling of despair and fear began to slowly creep away.   It, an oppressive, sticky sense of doom, like the worst, the darkest darkness, shivered and cringed, retreating before the bright, orange fire. For an instant the flame was as high as Ilya's face, but even that split second was enough to bring the young man to his senses, and the lighter was glowing with the usual flame.    And Prynora pressed the flame harder and harder against his chest, as if he knew that if he moved his hand a millimeter to the side, the darkness and the cold of the Dementors would bind him in rusty chains. Darkness and awkwardness still reigned around him, but within Ilya a fiery flower blossomed, taking root in the young man and giving him the sensation of fire running through his veins. It was a welcome and long-awaited sensation that only came when Ilya touched the strings of his guitar with his fingers.    Ilya looked up and saw that the Dementors wanted to swim toward him, stretching their arms, covered in deadly scabs, but they couldn't. They stared at the tiny light, afraid of it, and swam away, only to turn and stare greedily into Ilya's bright blue eyes.   There was a scream of horror from the stadium, and literally everyone's eyes fell on the broken doll, falling from the black heavens. There was a white glow, and Ilya recognized the doll as the figure of Potter, who appeared to be unconscious. It was only a couple of meters to the ground when everything around him shook with unimaginable magical power. Hair stood up on every part of his body where it grew, his breath snapped, and his thoughts tangled in themselves.    Ilya glanced at the faculty podium and saw Dumbledore holding his wand bare. Then he looked across the field and saw Potter hovering in midair. But besides the man never reached the ground, he froze and breathed, hundreds of thousands of water droplets. Then all at once they fell. And Ilya realized that sometimes a sniper rifle could not match the force of a nuclear explosion. It was the most powerful Leviossa anyone had ever seen. Dumbledore's magic was comparable only to the power of a titan descended from his mansions.   The Great Light Mage's lips quirked, his wand smudged in a sweep, and then everything was drowned in silver light. An enormous phoenix, woven with silver threads, spread its wings over the field. The phoenix was so big that it domed the stadium, resembling the mythical bird Rukh.    The Dementors shrieked and wailed as they flew away from this moon that had fallen to the ground, in the shape of a bird. The magical phoenix opened its beak and let out a low trill that sent a wave of magic so iridescent and luminous that the students' faces were transformed. The paths of tears dried, the shroud of fear disappeared from their eyes, and it seemed as if even the dark heavens had stopped their flood and opened their blinders, letting the life-giving powers of the sun to the earth.    In just an instant, Albus Dumbledore transformed the place, completely obliterating all the darkness and gloom that had accumulated here since the arrival of, as Muggle fantasy writers would say, the undead. And with a pop the phoenix split into thousands of feathers, tumbling and swirling in the cherry. Those Dementors who hadn't yet managed to get away fell beneath them and squealed in the infernal pain that the darkness was inflicting on the true, genuine light. Soon all was quiet and silent. People poured out onto the field, rushing to make their way to Harry. Isabelle and Lavender ran off, too. And the rest of the Scarlet Clan were on their way to see their friend and hero.    Ilya was alone, all alone in a completely empty sector. His umbrella was lying in a stream of brown, wet mud, trampled and broken, tattered and faded. Ilya rose from his seat, wobbled, but did not fall - grabbed the bench a tier higher, and then walked away. And only the light of the lighter, so simple, small and unsightly, was the only companion on the way from the stadium to the Forest. Only there, under the shadow of the crowns, among the eternal laughter of the wind in the leaves and grass, among the rustling of furry paws, weasel could feel himself a part of something bigger, something brighter than the space called - Ilya of Scary Square. Ilya hated being alone...                  October 21, 1993 England, Hovagrts               After the Dementor incident, the stakes were skyrocketing. Literally everyone was eager to bet money on one end of Potter or the other. Literally the phrase. All the vultures, as one, were betting that Goggles would make it. The others were eagerly throwing in bronze, silver, and sometimes even gold for the position - "He'll die.    The estimated profit, if Potter survived, would be about seventy galleons. If he did die, the loss would be almost a thousand gold pieces. Why would that be? It is too long and tedious to explain the economics of sweepstakes and the profits of those who arrange it. But one-fifth of seven tens of gold was also not a bad help for an orphan from an orphanage.    Not to mention the pictures. Oh, yes, this enterprise was really going to make a fortune. Already on the first day of underground sales, Ilya counted his own proceeds at almost a third of a galleon. And the Twins didn't think to stop there. They brought up a bartender in the "Boar's Head", who began to sell dirt for his own money. Some shrewd guy named Nuffer (I think his name was Mundungus Fletcher) got involved, and for his fee, he wanted to distribute the photos down Koskoy and Lutnoe Alley. As a result, in two days Ilya's personal profit reached the mark of almost a whole gold. The market theory was that sales would peak in the second month, so Ilya estimated that by the end of the year he would have enough money to buy himself a used car.    Didn't you know that? Ilya was a hardcore speed freak, a car freak, and a chopper freak. That Slavic priest had an old broken-down chopper in the barn behind the church, a Harley of a bearded year, but with a workshop plaque - a steel horse straight from America. The Russian or Ukrainian (you can't tell without a hundred grams of the famous drink) the theologian was better at metal than the scripture, and Ilya and Rosie, who shared his love, sometimes disappeared for long periods of time in that shed to work with Harley and broken-down Chevrolet, which could only be called sporty if you turn back time fifteen years.    And now, perhaps, Ilya will save up the money for his machine, and he will have a sports broom and his own car. It is not a paradise for yesterday's bum from the most dreary and criminal area of not only London, but the whole of Foggy Albion.   - What's that under your desk? - Suddenly Snape barked in my ear.   - Legs, sir," answered Ilya, whose voice, because of the respirator, sounded somewhat strange.   With a wave of his wand, the potter pulled the student aside and examined everything carefully. Then he hissed something and hissed:   - Keep your eyes peeled, Mr. Ilya.   Ilya, if he had his way, would have poured this very potion into the toilet, where, in Ilya's opinion, it belonged. But there was nothing to do, so I had to saw another abomination and slowly pour it into the cauldron, at the same time adding to the flame. Today was an independent job and everyone stood on their own. On the table, apart from the abominations, there was one phial, which had to be filled with "moonshine". In fact, it was on this phial that your mark would be emblazoned afterwards. Weasel, as always, was aimed exclusively at "P". But the process of "chemistry" was even more difficult for him than Transfiguration, so the boy's efforts were worthy of all admiration for such a firm will.    And as you can imagine. As soon as the pictures appeared in the castle walls, the owner of the image depicted on them found out about it. He simply couldn't help but find out, because Gemini and Ilya had slipped the pictures under his door late that night. Snape had been moping around ever since, and he'd been brutal ever since. He paced the entire castle, circling the dungeons a mile away, where Mr. Bat reigned. Ilya just grunted and strode regally past the Bastard.   After all, we know perfectly well that Ilya does not forget debts, neither those of others, nor, more importantly, his own. And Severus-give-him-a-shampoo-Snape owed his student a lot. So Illya had paid it back. Now it was McGee's turn, who was on the counter for that fluffy trick.    - Let's turn in our work! - Snape yelled, taking a seat at the table.   Ilya filled the vial and blew it off with a show of charms, maneuvering his way around the lined line. Everyone turned to the guy who had already gathered for the exit and looked at him with obvious anger. After all, Illyena had to stand in line and stuff. But, as they say, include your head sometimes and do not forget that you're fucking mages, and the shelf can not only pick in the known places.             Weasel, wasting no time, directed his footsteps to the floor with the teachers' offices. Today, that day, was scheduled for another "class" with Professor Flitwick. As Ilya moved up the ancient stone steps, which were safely hidden in all corners of the castle, he thought about the fact that today he would probably ruin his relationship with the goblin for some part, but it was impossible otherwise.    Ilya did not tolerate weakness in people, he did not tolerate whiners, brats, losers, and those who were ready to cry on the shoulder of their neighbors and the casual. Ilya was sure that all that you need to say this sensual and acute, you can say to the mirror, and then throw away, because neither you nor the world, weakness was not needed. Weakness is like a sentence - if you show it (weakness) and all, you'll be eaten, crumpled up and take away all that can be taken away, and then even obliged to give throughout life. That was the law of Scary Square and St. Frederick's, and that was the law of what people call "humane and civilized" society.   Ilya did not tolerate weakness, and all these days he could not tolerate himself. After all, he had let himself go, he had failed to deal with the problem, he had let someone else decide things for him. Yeah, maybe half a thousand other students couldn't handle the Dementors, but Illya didn't care about them. What did he care what others could and couldn't do, if he couldn't do it himself. How could he not tolerate the likes of Potter the sniveling, Malfoy the weak-assed, Granger the Dangerous, Ron the...condom, if he found himself the same way. Just a whiny kid looking for protection from someone strong.   No, Ilya hated himself for this epichod. For succumbing to such a trifle as fear, for allowing himself to plunge into something as insignificant as despair. For betraying everything that he considered the most important thing in life - the ability to always keep his tail between his legs. It turns out that Ilya showed himself not only weak, but also a traitor. And there was simply nowhere lower to fall, it could not go any lower. And something had to be done about it. He might have to go through the valley of the shadow of death again, but not a soul in this godforsaken world would be able to say that Ilya the Hippogriff-Ilya the wizard of Skary Square was nothing more than a weakling, a traitor, and a scoundrel. No, that will never happen.   Weasel took the key to Flitwick's private office out of his pocket and twisted it in the keyhole. Cheerfully, as always, the tongue clicked and with a creak the door unlocked. The professor wasn't in the spacious, bright room; he was waiting for the Slytherin down there.   As he passed by the guitar, Ilya froze for a moment, but then walked decisively to the knight's armor and turned the hilt of his sword. The knight bowed as if alive, as usual, and stepped aside, revealing behind him a blackening passage and a steep spiral staircase.   Ilya took a step forward, leaving his Babe behind him. No, he couldn't allow those strings to be touched by the fingers of the lowlife he'd turned into in just a couple of days. What kind of music could he play? Only the kind that would make all the gods of music turn their backs on him and never come back again. No, he had no right to touch the guitar.   Weasel descended the stairs and found himself in a corridor filled with all sorts of doors that literally glowed with the number of protective and locking charms on them. But the Slytherin's path lay further, to the very last and largest of the doors.   With each step weasel was imbued with the atmosphere of this part of the castle. An atmosphere of determination, of courage, of not accepting any laws or limits. All that was important and sacred to the young man, and all that he had betrayed because of his own weakness. But all that Ilya intended to reclaim for himself. And then to forget this episode as he had forgotten all the filth, lies, deceit, evil, blackness, despair, and other things that were abundant in the Scary Square orphan.    "Never remember evil!" - a motto from one of Ilya's favorite books, had long ago become his motto, too. He knew that life was so short and beautiful that it would be the height of idiocy to remember darkness. And it was certainly not the way to nurture it in himself, to complain that this was the way to rise above others. No, that was the way of someone else, but not of Ilya Ilya.   The doors of the hall swung open and Ilya stepped under the vault, where the magic shrouds summoned by the two-time European Duel Champion were already swirling. Flitwick stood on the platform, twirling his wand in his fingers. He was expecting a Slytherin, and pride splashed in his eyes. And like a sharp, poisonous sting, that pride plunged into Ilya's heart. No, he was not worthy of the praise, the joy that radiated from the enchantment master's eyes after the summer.    For then, after the first "class" of the year, Flitwick had said that Ilya had finally taken off. That for the first time in a year and a half, he had begun not to defend himself, hoping to resist the onslaught of a superior opponent, but to attack - wanting to defeat that very enemy. The desire to win, that was what was central to the flight.    - Let's begin, Ilya," the tip of Filius's wand glowed, but the enchantment never snapped into action.   - Professor," said Ilya in an alien, husky, cracked voice, and shrunk in size.    His bright eyes suddenly faded, and even his very beauty turned to some inner ugliness. This did not escape the tenacious gaze of a small almost-man, with a huge light heart.    - What's wrong with you, Ilya? Are you sick?   Ilya shook his head, then said:   - I'm sorry, Professor, but I have to break our agreement...   - Go on.   - ? ... ? ... I... want to ask you to teach me a spell. A spell that will help me deal with the Dementors!   Flitwick, who had tensed a moment ago after that phrase, suddenly relaxed and walked over to Ilya. He clapped the Slytherin on the back and sat down on the edge of the platform. With childlike directness and nonchalance, for some part the goblin began to wiggle his feet in the air.   - Have a seat, Ilya.   Weasel shuddered, but sat down next to him, very close. From the outside, if you didn't know better, you'd think a father was talking to his son, or a grandfather to his grandson. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that at all. Or maybe it was, but Ilya didn't know who "father" was, only what the word was.   - I cannot teach you that," said Flitwick, sighing heavily, and meeting the Slytherin's nearly dead eyes, he added immediately. - "But not because I don't want to! I would give a lot to give you that knowledge. But I don't have it myself, you see.   - But...   - Don't even try Ilya, these are too great secrets of magic that I am in a hurry to reveal to you. Ilya, you didn't manage to master either occlusion, did you? And that is why you wore first a bandana of insulating cloth, and then this hat, with a hem of the same material?   - Yes," the young man admitted mournfully.   - And that's not surprising," the professor smiled warmly. - I can quite understand you. See these earrings? They're not a whim of mine, not a tribute to goblin tradition. They're amulets to protect my thoughts. I can't master the science of mind protection, either.   - It's... it's... it's kind of...   - Shocking?   - Exactly.   Flitwick laughed.   - But Professor, what does occlusion have to do with my request?   - Now, now, I can explain...ah...ah," Flitwick hissed in another coughing fit, but held up his hand to indicate that he was all right. When the fit was over, the old man said. - "This cold... You see Ilya. The patronus spell, which is what will help you when you encounter a Dementor, is a High Magic spell. And ninety-nine percent of High Magic is the symbiosis of one branch of magic and the most ancient and profound one - Mental Magic.   - I read something about her... - I've read something about her.   - Of course you have. After all, it was the basis of all current magical science! It is the very foundation of magic. It is the basis of magic, which nature had deprived me and, sadder still, you of. You see, we have no ability for mental magic.    - I still don't understand.   - No wonder," Flitwick snorted. - Imagine you need to animate the stone statues. Where would you get the intelligence for them to be able to distinguish between allies and enemies? Where would you get the skills to hold weapons for them? Where will you get everything else for them? Only in the mind - in your mind, Ilya. And part of that mind you will for a time, by magic, put into an animated sculpture, endowing it with some of your own, as well as your own-utrilized, qualities. It is the same with all Higher Magic, it always has a part of your "I". And a Patronus, in addition, is its incarnation. The Patronus is not only the Highest Light Magic, but also the apogee, the very essence of the Mental. But you and I know that until you try it, you won't know. So here's the thing Ilya. Imagine your brightest, happiest memory, then make such waves and say: ExpectoPatronum!   And Ilya closed his eyes. It wasn't worth the trouble to get that happiest memory. It was not worth the trouble to get them two, five, twenty, almost a hundred. Ilya, who left no evil or darkness in his soul, always lived in the light and in the light. Images of his friends were replaced by pictures of Egypt, and then childhood, and the Forest, and the broom, and Hogwarts, and thousands more. Ilya filled his whole self with a sense of infinite joy, fun, happiness, and life.    He and Flitwick didn't know it, but the ghosts in the vicinity were howling in pain and horror and scurrying away. The portraits of the once-living humans glowed, and the humans darted away. They did not know that the torches in the corridor behind the doors suddenly flashed like stars. They did not know that all the fire in the castle and next to it danced, as if welcoming someone whom they had been waiting for so long, someone whom they no longer hoped to see in this world, someone dear, close to them.    - ExpectoPatronus!" said the young man.   But nothing happened. The tip of the wand blinked, and that was it.   - That's what I had to prove," Flitwick sighed. - Any wizard, even the most unlucky one, would have a faint silvery cloud projecting his self from his wand. But you and I can't even do that.   - Professor," Ilya said again, tapping himself on the chin. - It turns out that by using Higher Magic, a person separates a piece of the mind...   - Only for a while, then it comes back. The ancient sages even used it to expand the boundaries of their perception. However, I know a magician who still dabbles in it. He's also the headmaster of a school you know.   - Um...   - But... you seem to be thinking about something else.   - Avada Kedavra sir. I understand how it works.   Flitwick smiled and nodded his head, offering to continue:   - After all, it separates the soul from the body, but how can you separate Yin from Yang? The soul from the body? Only if you cheat the universe. It seems that the principle of symbiosis works here. The magician takes a particle, a small particle of his soul, and attaches it to the soul of the incanted. But that particle is already dead and must go on, and the power of the pull is so great that it takes away both the particle and the whole soul. This spell, so powerful and dangerous, is essentially a simple deception.   - Bravo, Ilya. Many people need hours of lectures and hundreds of sentences of complex explanations to understand it.    - But that knowledge will not help me with my question," Weasel grimaced.   - But perhaps another will help," the professor winked. - Ilya, magic never gives anything without taking something in return. But this law works in the opposite sense, too. I have been observing your sorcery for a long time, Ilya, and I repent, I know what your talent is, what your payment is, for your lack of abilities in Mental Magic.   Flitwick waved his hand and a vase appeared out of thin air on the platform. A beautiful, porcelain vase.   - Get her in the air.   - Win...   - No, no. No words. Lift her into the air non-verbally Ilya.   - But....   - You won't know until you try it.   Ilya looked at the professor with skepticism, and then mentally said the right formula with a wave of his wand. A moment and the vase was floating in the air. Ilya's mouth opened slightly, and his eyes opened like windows in the morning. It was so easy, so simple, not at all like they write in textbooks.   - You will never master High Magic and Mental Magic, but your talent is non-slave spells. Perhaps something else. Magic is always fair and takes and gives - equally.    Filius waved his wand again, and the vase disappeared. And the young man was transformed, handsome again, his eyes shining like jewels in the sunlight. The weasel grew taller, his shoulders and back straightened.   - Professor, I... I...   - You have to run - get to work. Go ahead, Ilya, fly in your own stream and never look down again. The earth is not for us.   The young man nodded, jumped off the platform and ran for the door. But he stopped, turned, and uttered a "ritual phrase:   - Thank you, Professor.   And heard the "ritualistic response."   - You're welcome, Ilya. Absolutely nothing.   Weasel literally flew out the doors, and they slammed shut behind the boy's back with a noise. Ilya ran for the stairs before he saw Flitwick, sitting on the platform, coughing again.               October 30, 1993 England Hogwarts             Ilya set the point and stretched sweetly. Everything was ready. He had literally been in his den day and night for the past nine days. He'd even missed a few classes by taking Pomfrey's sick leave. But still, everything was ready. Yes, his first spell. The very first one. The one he hadn't learned in class, the one he hadn't found in a textbook, the one he'd made himself from start to finish. Twelve levels, forty-one operations, nine non-verbal constructs, two Junior and three Senior runes (it took him several hundred hours and a couple of liters of blood from his nose and ears to cram the runes), and two verbal constructs, and the spell was finished.    All in all it took a gigantic number of hours to work, considering that the idea originated so long ago. But still - Ilya pulled it off. He took all his intelligence, courage, and faith, and melted something new out of them, something the world had never seen before. It was an amazing feeling to know that you could create something. To create something out of nothing.   Ilya was sitting among a pile of scribbled parchment, among the donated papers, a typewriter, and dozens of empty ink jars. And in his diary there was only a two-page entry, with movements and a formula, both verbal and non-verbal.    Still, something was keeping Illya from venturing into the woods to try out his creation. That something was a letter yellowed with old age. The letter, a copy of which Ilya had inadvertently summoned from his Berloga. Apparently the original lay somewhere in the immense library or in the bowels of the castle. What interested the lad in the message was only the inscription, "To the Prophet, for England.   Ilya had never opened another man's mail, but he was English, so this letter was for him, too. Weasel stretched himself sweetly, yawned, and took the envelope in his hands. Now that his business was done, he could afford a little diversion.    With a crunch the wax seal split open, and a thin sheet of paper of a message descended into Illyes' lap.            "I know that this letter will never be published, it will never even reach the shores of the country to which I have caused so much evil. Perhaps it is the right thing to do. Evil should not stand beside good, and I have been evil. For a short time, a couple of years, but how many terrible things I managed to do in those sad days. How many orphans I've left behind, how many widows, how many fathers, how many children I've outlived... no, it's too much for a human to handle, well, let's thank magic that I'm not a human.    This letter will never be published, so I can proudly say - I'm not human. And so all the curses you sprinkle on my head at night can rightly begin with, "You vile wretch," though I know you say it anyway, you can't help saying, what I did was inhuman, was horrible...   However, if you're wondering who I am, ask your government or the valiant Aurors. They know, they always have.   You may ask why I'm writing. I don't know. My heart is asleep in another room, and there's only a bottle of whiskey on the table, not even ice for a glass... So I'm writing. I can't not write. It is silly and low to ask for forgiveness, and even more so to hope that you will forgive me, but still I ask, from my heart, from my soul, with sincerity unknown to me until now, I ask forgiveness for what I have done.   I wish I could say, the devil, how I wish I could say that it wasn't all of my will, but it wasn't. It was all part of me, all the hatred, all the rage toward the mages, it wasn't from whoever you call Vol-de-Mort-that he didn't create it in my soul, it was always there, and I only gave an outlet. And yet I apologize. For the blood, for the tears, for the flames that have not warmed you, but burned you to ashes, to the ground. And for the ashes, too, I ask forgiveness.   Oh, my heart is awake, it's in labor. Here I have to interrupt and write one last time - forgive me.    Well, I hope this washes my hands a little bit. You can't hold children with bloody hands. I know that.   Faustus Liebflem."               Ilya reread the letter a few more times, and then folded it several times and put it away in the edge of the table. It was a pity it could not be taken out of the room, but weasel decided that he would find the original. And when he found it, he would hide it to reflect on the text later. Probably in a couple of years, when the time of mysteries comes. Because this year is a year free of mysteries and mysteries.   Weasel gathered his things, ran his fingers through the brim of his hat, and moved toward the dungeons. There he would leave everything superfluous behind and continue on his way - to the edge of the territory, where he, having fought the Dementors, would reclaim himself. Chapter 26   October 30, 1993, England, the Enchanted Forest                       Ilya lit a cigarette, took a drag, and set the magic phone on the ground. Fighting Dementors without music was like Thanksgiving without turkey - not kosher. Ilya adjusted his hat and began squatting with his arms outstretched forward. After that he did a few bends at his sides, and then began to stretch out his arms, crunching all his vertebrae.   And around them swayed dark, as if rotted trees. This corner of the forest, the darkest place, where the most horrible creatures lived, weasel had only been there once. According to Hogwarts lore no wizard ever found his way into this part of the forest alive. But weasel had a gut feeling that he had to stay on the path, and he stayed there.   Ilya had seen such horrible creatures that his heart was ready to freeze and jump out of his chest. Seen such horrors as could only be found at the bottom of witchcraft, witchcraft dark, grim. But still, as long as Ilya stood on the path, these monsters and unimaginable creatures did not touch him. In two and a half years, Ilya had explored the entire forest, even been to the kentar camp, but he never returned here. Not until he heard that this was where the Dementors were huddled. Where else would they be, though.   As Ilya warmed up, smoking a cigarette at the same time, the air around him grew thicker and stinkier. The dew on the black, rotted, rotten grass began to freeze, covering everything around it with a thin crust of frost. My heart was in a dangerous, steel vice. An alarm bell sounded in my temples.   Finally Ilya straightened up and looked up at the sky. Here it was not visible, instead only the black crowns, like the dome of a shrinking abyss. Among the stench and decay was heard the light, almost glossy rustling of grave shrouds. Lusciously tender notes of dead agony and howling ghosts touched the ear. A howl was heard in the distance, the howl of a creature so terrible and deadly that its mere presence would send you over the edge. But this creature, too, frightened those who were coming for their prey.   Dementors flew like moths to a light in the night. To them, the young wizard was like a speck of life in the earth, ruled only by the merciless laughter of Death.   - What shall I put on? - Ilya thoughtfully stretched out, holding two cassettes in his hands.   One was AC/DC "High way to hell" from '79, the other was AC/DC "TnT" from '84. At last Ilya put the second cassette into the machine with determination. He pressed the play button and the first notes of the immortal hit flashed through the dark forest.   Dementors swirled around, and Weasel felt himself slowly melting into the darkness. But he kept afloat in that pool of blackest oil, so lingering, so alluring. Brian Johnson's vocal outbursts flew through the forest, and even the trees seemed to crackle to the beat of the track.   - Well, who wants a commissioner's body? - Ilya smirked, sending his cigarette flying in a distant flight toward the nearest raincoat.   A cold cloud burst from Weasel's mouth, crumbling in a flash of fine snow dust.   - Don't be shy, gentlemen, come up one by one, cloak in the hollow.   It was as if the Dementors had been waiting for this invitation and immediately lied in rapid flight. Standing on the edge of the abyss of his own consciousness, the weasel raised his red, flaming wand. It flickered and swirled, conjuring up impossible, intricate figures and symbols. And mentally, silently, the weasel recited the lines of his spell. And with each new syllable, with each new word, the wand ignited like a campfire in the silence of the night.   Finally the last formula sounded, and the wand was ready to represent the Elder Rune, binding the verbal and non-verbal forms together.   - Welcome to hell, creatures," Ilya smiled dangerously, quite beastly, and said:   - IgnisBestia: Papilios!   The hand completed the rune, and at the same instant a torrent of flame burst from the depths of Weasel's soul to the scarlet wand. It mingled with the magic, beating like a faint spring, and swirled her around in a frantic swing. So fast that she couldn't tell one from the other.   My eyes were stabbed by the flash of bright, red flames bursting from the tip of the blazing tree. A huge, surreally large cloud of flame swirled among the forest, scorching everything that could be scorched. Burning rotten grass to the ground, turning ancient trees to ashes, heating the air to such a degree that skin would burst like an inflated balloon, hair would burn like dry straw. But Ilya stood amidst this chaos of fire as if nothing was happening. Tongues of flame touched his neck and face, but they left no trace, no burning, but as if they were glossing and caressing him like a long bored dog.   The Dementors howled and swam away, trying to hide in the darkness. But the cloud wouldn't let them do that. It suddenly shrank to a point, narrowed, becoming so dense that it could be weighed on a scale, and then exploded a moment later. But it didn't disappear in a bright flash, it split into dozens, hundreds, thousands of little balls. They began to stretch, to change, and soon took the form of the creatures that Ilya had most trouble with in transfiguration.   The dark woods were swirling with a myriad of fiery swarms, ready to strike at Ilya's gesture alone. And he didn't keep his creation waiting. Ilya waved his wand, and with that swing, the disparate fire-butterflies joined together in a single stream and rushed toward the Dementors.   The dark cloaked figures shrieked and screeched and tried to separate, but they didn't stand a chance. Weasel swung once more, like a conductor before an orchestra, and a long plume of mahouts separated from the stream, lassoing around several of the mortals who tried to escape with their escape.   These whips of butterflies woven from the fire dragged the fugitives into a group of a dozen more Dementors. They howled their low, ear-splitting howls and tried to get out of the forming ball of flaming mahouts. But they couldn't even touch the magic. One touch of a scab-covered hand on those fluttering creatures and the dead man's paw would show terrible, black burns, and at times the flesh would erupt, revealing yellow bone.   Soon the dungeon of flames was formed, imprisoning a dozen cloaks. Weasel kept twirling his wand, and the butterflies fluttered in time with these movements. Their wings touched the trees, leaving not burns but long, deep scalpel cuts on them. But when their bodies pressed against the bark, they left behind them only blazing flames and black, charred patches.   Ilya froze, as if waiting for something, and then, as the last lines of the hit sounded through the forest, uttered:   - The final chord.   With those words, he raised his wand to the sky, and the swallows fluttered their wings furiously. As the wand whistled down to the ground, the first of Ilya's Flaming Beasts swooped in to attack.   A new howl swept through the clearing, not scary, not frightening, but pitiful. The Dementors tried to escape, to fly away, but they didn't stand a chance. The Machaons tore them to rags, and burned them like bursting fuel. There was a squeal and a squeak and a crackle of flame, and the rampaging spell was finishing its work. The burning scraps of ancient cloaks and smoking chunks of flesh fell to the ground. In a few seconds, it was over.   Ilya took out another cigarette and twitched the stick lightly. One of the swallows flew up and landed on the cigarette. It went up in smoke and Ilya took in the fragrant smoke with pleasure. He covered his eyes and released his charms. Butterflies began to decay, and soon the gloom settled on the clearing again, and the only reminders of the recent battle were islands of flame, black, scorched circles, and the smell of burning in the air.   Pronira listened to his senses and realized that he was capable of summoning these particular Flaming Beasts seven, or even nine more times. The other Beasts were not ready yet, but Pronyrrha knew for sure that by the end of the year he would finish them as well.   - Heh," Ilya said with a chuckle, shaking off the ashes. - I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I've given you the rotation, and the axis of the rotation is my penis.   Ilya, with his wand at the ready, stepped resolutely off the path and approached the tree. Magically and physically he was not the least bit tired, but mentally it was not very easy. That's why Weasel, after knocking out his magic phone, slowly slid down the trunk to the hot ground. He tucked his right leg in, and exhaled several rings of smoke, sending them toward the burnt dark crone.   - That's what I understand," Ilya chuckled nervously. - That's a fight. It's not like shoving a stick up a troll's nose.   - Woof!   Ilya shuddered and pointed his wand sharply in the direction of the dog's barking. I don't know what kind of creature could be in these cursed places. But there, among the bushes, was an ordinary dog. Except it was too big and too black. I could mistake him for a Grim.   - I see I had an audience," the boy snorted and beckoned the animal over. - Come here, buddy, it's more fun with two people.   The dog tilted his head sideways as if pondering, but then moved forward. When he stepped into the light, Weasel whistled. The dog was clearly a war dog. All disheveled, lean, even thin, dirty, obviously tired.   - After the fight, too? - Weasel asked, scratching the dog's thick fur.   He stared into Ilya's face at first, then turned his muzzle sharply toward the faculty patch. The dog recoiled and bellowed loudly. Ilya was shocked. To his memory, this was the first animal that had ever decided to snarl at a young man. However, Ilya immediately realized that the dog might growl not at him but at the snake depicted on the coat of arms.   - What, you don't like snakes? I don't either, although I did have a snake friend, but still. Funny, studying in a department whose crest is not your most pleasant creature. And if only that, then the whole faculty treat you as you treat their crest.   After this speech, the dog stopped growling, bowed his head sideways again, and then returned to the young man. He, with his grimy paw, smudged the faculty patch, then barked as if laughing, and settled down beside him.   - Now that's original," Ilya said respectfully, peering at the right side of the robe. - Shall we get acquainted? My name is Ilya Ilyaom, my nickname is Weasel. And what's yours?   The dog lifted his right ear and twitched his tail.   - Yeah, stupid question. All right, you'll be... - Ilya thought about it. - Okay, you be Orange.   The dog snorted.   - I can't call you Chernysh. That's too corny. So get used to it-- Orange. Maybe I'll paint you that color later. Ron tried to paint his rat, but it didn't fucking work.   The dog, nicknamed Orange, growled again at the word "rat".   - What, you don't like rats either? Can't blame you for that, though," Weasel finished his cigarette and burnt the cigarette, pulling out a second one. - Do you want one? Though dogs don't smoke, but I reckon you'd like one. I don't want to be ranked as the Antichrist by Green-Piss," Proudfoot said.   Weasel gasped again, the dog wagging his tail.   - You're a strange animal. You growl at me, you smell weird... Anyway, it's a mystery-free year. With Potter and his crew, you could pass detective school early.   Orange pricked up his ears and moved a little closer.   - What, you've heard of Harry Potter, too? - Ilya grinned, ruffling the animal's hair. - Almost everyone in England has heard of him. But when I talked to people in other countries, they knew next to nothing about the Dark Lord or Scar Boy. Like there was a civil war and everything.   The dog snorted again and laid his head in the young man's lap.   - Sorry, no food. I haven't eaten since this morning. I did a good job on those hoodlums, though.   Orange barked loudly and poked the guy in the chest.   - That's what I'm saying. Don't tell anybody I pissed them off, okay? I'm already being treated like a juvenile delinquent, and now I'm getting wet... Besides, what the fuck kind of juvenile gangster am I? I'm just an ordinary gangster. A musician too, but that's another story.   The dog snorted as if he wanted to laugh, and Ilya smiled at the joke he'd made on himself.   - Oh, that's my life, isn't it? The first spell was successfully cast, but there was no one to celebrate with. After serving time with the Russians, drinking with the elders seems to me like an easy party in a nursing home. And there's no vodka to be found here. Oh, boy.   Orange snorted and wagged his tail as if to encourage him.   - I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight, and I was in the middle of a fight. I would have been taken to the ministry and tortured for example how I killed those cloaks. Because according to the laws of magic, you can't kill them. I would have opened their eyes to the truth by getting them to read the Ancient Records and the manuscripts from the Library of Alexandria, but they all had the same idea that Dementors were created to fight the Fae, and the only ones who could kill them.   The dog froze and even became more attentive.   - And what does that make us? That I'm Fae? But they died out in the middle of the Morgana-LaFay junta's battle against Comrade Merlin and his majesty Arthur Pendragon.   The weasel exhaled a few puffs of smoke again, then lit a third cigarette.   - Okay, Orange. Today is a day off from being free from mystery. I got an idea. I don't think I'm human, tail.   The dog barked and snarled.   - Laugh it up, flea-bitten. But the facts speak for themselves. One of my parents was probably not of the human race. I mean, look at my flame-beast charms. You know what it's all about? It's just some non-verbal "P" crap on Toad Charms! How many Senior Runes are there? The hardest Beast has five, five fucking things! And I looked it up... the most versed in the runes knows a maximum of seven, and can use no more than two, or even one. I learn them like a schoolboy learns poetry, and they're easy to use, too.   The dog froze again and even turned toward the young man, flashing his overly intelligent, gray eyes.   - Well, bro, that's some bullshit going on. I'm at the very minimum of my strength to barely make it through high school, but with the flame charms, I could be a seventh-year student right now! It's a paradox, my friend. The weakest, strongest in the most difficult spells. Another paradox is that one who can't master Mental Magic has no difficulty with non-verbal magic. This is all paradoxes, but the Elder Runes don't fit into them. It's like Professor Bubbling said, "too complicated for the human mind." So it's fine for the non-human mind. So it turns out, Orange, that I'm not human. Well, not half human.   Tailed pressed his head against his knee, showing that he was sympathetic.   - Oh, don't do that. I don't like pity. None of us like it... You know, it's funny, though, I mean, I've got spells that no one else on earth could ever master. And the best part is, I invented them myself. You'd understand, because you never had anything of your own. And others won't understand... But we don't need them to understand, do we?   The dog barked in agreement.   - All right, tail, I've been talking to you, and I've got a concert to give in the Vulture Lounge... Didn't I tell you? You just fell into the lap of the future King of Rock! So you can brag amongst your own kind. Yeah, well, if you're particularly hungry, you're three hours away. There's a rabbit hill in a couple of miles. If you're not a sucker, you can catch your dinner. So long, Orange.   With these words Ilya jumped up, ruffled the dog's stiff fur one last time, lifted the magic phone on his shoulder and set off, whistling the immortal tune. The strange dog lounged in the clearing for a while longer, and then turned around exactly three hours and rushed in the indicated direction.               October 31, 1993 England, Hogwarts                   In a couple of minutes dinner was about to start, and Ilya was still sitting in his den. In front of him, on the table, was a list of the essentials of the evening.   - Knife," Ilya read out and checked his pocket. - Got it.   - Smoke bomb," Weasel continued and checked the other, "In stock.   - Self-shooter," Ilya turned down his pant leg and found a tool attached to his shin there. - It's fully operational.   - Wand," Ilya instantly snatched his faithful battle buddy from his back pocket. - Always with you.   - Dry rations in case of evacuation, - in the bag there was a necessary torque bag with the most necessary things. - It was prepared in advance.   - A hundred pounds and five galleons of NZ," Weasel rummaged through his pockets, his bag, but couldn't find what he was looking for. - Had he forgotten... Or had someone stolen...   Ilya continued his search, and soon came across a stack of gold coins and a snap of banknotes. The money went into the inside pockets of the vest in a jiffy.   - I declare myself ready for another Halloween," Ilya called out to himself in the mirror and headed out.   Given the experience of previous years, this year Ilya decided to approach the problem more thoroughly. Living in the same castle with Potter, you can not be sure that "31st, the tenth" will not happen some kavabunga. For example, there will be a global flood and you will be crushed by the fallen elephant monument, or suddenly some laboratory will explode and the world will be covered by the zombie apocalypse. In general, every Halloween some heresy was bound to happen, and very dangerous for your own life. So you should have been prepared.   Ilya carefully studied the evacuation plans, the maps of Hogsmeade, read the special literature, and considered himself ready for any trouble. In general, the easiest solution was to quietly remove Ochkarik, so he did not poison people's lives, but Ilya did not want to spend more than a minute in prison. So he had to twist and turn around, in order to keep his own skin intact.   After climbing down the stairs, which again attempted to finish the young man off, Ilya found himself at the door of the Great Hall. The atmosphere in the castle was as festive as ever, and Flitwick had made a big splash this year.   Today there were dangers all day long. Skeletons jumped out of the walls, portraits turned out to be disguised, fake monsters, stepping on the carpet you could fall into a small hole with magic quicksand, taking the railing - to get into fake, sweet, but bright blood, and in general, all day long students were provided with various tests on fortitude and strength of mind.   By evening, the Hall and Great Hall looked like a crypt. Fake ghosts hovered under the ceiling, startling the students with their sharp dives and hollow howls. Spiderwebs dangled everywhere, with transfigured pseudo-acromantulas that could land on your shoulder or head. There were cackling, glowing pumpkins flying around, sometimes whispering terrible threats of a quick but painful death in your ear. And that, the unmoving figure of the surreal monster, could suddenly come to life and leap under your feet, scaring you to graying temples.   But Ilves liked it - Hogwarts had amazing holidays. True, they would have been even better if not for the presence of the Golden Trio here. The weasel didn't believe in the curse of the post, but the curse of the Trio and the feast did. Besides, Potter's parents had died that day, so it would have been more understandable if the bespectacled boy had been visiting their grave on the 31st, rather than causing trouble for the whole castle. But such matters were a matter of internal organization and upbringing.   But the door of the Hall swung open, and Ilya swallowed his saliva and forgot all his thoughts and business. When free food is on the horizon, you should not fill your head with such empty problems. The most important thing is to fill your belly and the whole world can wait.               A couple of kilos of food later.                   Ilya, having waddled with the faculty to the living room, thought that it was worth believing the proverb of the scouts. The first time was an accident, two times a coincidence, three times a pattern. That is, since only two Halloweens had passed, it was not necessary to say that Potter had cursed the holiday with his presence.   The people began to disperse to their rooms, and Ilya decided to sit down on a cozy sofa and relax a little after the food marathon. Most likely, the sixth piece of cake was already unnecessary. And I shouldn't have chewed two chickens. Two whole chickens. But habits are habits, they're hard to break. And if you've heard for twelve years that free food is higher than holy, you can't get rid of such notions in two years.   Weasel himself did not notice how he sank into a sweet slumber. And it seemed to him that only a couple of minutes had passed before Flint's wild yell was heard:   - Everybody gather round and line up! We're going to the Great Hall!   - What, is the banquet still going on? - Ilya, who had been asleep for a long time, turned to the headman.   - No, Potter was attacked in the living room by Black.   Silence.   - It's not a joke.   - I'm just dicking around with my genius," and with a ringing slap, Ilya's palm said hello to his face.   He doesn't seem to have another normal holiday for another four years. Chapter 27   December 8, 1993 England, Hogwarts                       Winter. Oh this beautiful word - winter. The time when you go out in the street you will definitely check if you have a warm hat on your head, a colorful or even colorless scarf on your neck, and under a thick coat or down jacket you will have warm clothes.   That time when in the morning and in the evening, frost patterns appear on the windows, so diverse and artistic, as if a brilliant artist walks with a special brush and leaves his masterpieces on the simple glass. When you can always hear the laughter of children in the streets, molding snowballs or playing snowballs, trying to beat the enemy.   When, going out for a walk with your girlfriend, you will definitely try to shovel her in the snow, or drop white flakes from the nearest branch. When even the most fleeting kiss is like a charcoal applied to the lips. Winter, the table is a beautiful time when everything around is wrapped in a white, fluffy blanket. A time for evening gatherings by the fireplace and warm embraces. Winter... Ilya realized more and more that he hated this time, this winter.   Wrapping himself in a worn gray drapery coat with a high collar, putting on a hat with earflaps donated by the Russians, and putting on thick gloves, Prunyra went out into the hall. Almost the whole school from the third to seventh year had already gathered here. In connection with the emergence of Dementors on the border of the territory, only after three and a small months, the students decided to release to Hogsmeade. Now everyone was standing near the exit, showing Filch and McGee, standing next to him, their permission to visit the magical village.   Mr. and Mrs. had signed the paper before Ilya even thought of asking them to do so. So there was nothing wrong with the ex-bosoda's credentials. The same could not be said for the Potter in front, who, as usual, could not do without excesses. But the worst part was that he was holding up the whole line.   - But, ma'am, why don't you sign? - Goggles almost squeaked.   - I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, but the rules say that either a parent or a guardian has to sign. I'm really sorry.   - But...   - Harry," Hermione cut in. - Maybe it's for the best. It's not safe for you to leave school right now.   - Mr. Potter, Miss Granger says some very reasonable things," the Iron Lady smiled slightly.   - Yeah, buddy, and we'll get you all kinds of goodies," Ron clapped his friend on the shoulder and smiled broadly. - And we'll tell you all the interesting stuff.   Potter sighed heavily, whispered something in reply, took his sheet, and departed, shoulders slumped mournfully. Ilya, pulling his ID card from his bag, just in time to see how the Blizen jumped out of the queue and led Potter under the arm into some nook. They're up to something again...   McGonagall checked the document for almost five minutes. She spun it, twisted it, shined her wand at it, sniffed at it, and maybe even tasted it on her teeth. Ilya the whole time just rolled his eyes and stomped on the spot, trying to warm himself somehow. Weasel hated the cold even more than winter, and since they always walked side by side, Ilya hated the cold winter twice, if not threefold.   - It doesn't look fake," the deputy director gave her verdict.   - You could have just asked," Ilya sighed, taking the document and walking out the school gate.   The weasel lifted his collar, hiding his chin in it, and slowly crunched his boots into the annoyingly white snow. A snowball flew past, which Ilya dodged by swinging back slightly. The freshmen rushed past, using levitation charms for their amusement. They were having fun, and Weasel was chortling. It was like this every winter, but in recent years, the weaving peculiarity of the young man was becoming more pronounced. And this time the moping was joined by bad moods and bouts of unreasonable irritation and even anger.   The boy was not only bored, he was also always getting into trouble, picking fights. But no one wanted to fight with Ilya. Maybe because at fourteen with a tail, weasel looked at all seventeen, or maybe just for reasons of humanity. And wanted to fight, wanted to stand tall and punch someone in a satisfied face. But, alas, mages preferred to fight with wands rather than fists. Which, in a way, was fine too. But there was a lot of damage to be done in a magic duel, and it was a hell of a lot more common than a regular scuffle. He was so excited to fight, to warm up, to warm up...   - Ilya, wait! - A sound came from behind me.   At first Ilya thought it was his buddies, but they were out on dates, and there was no chance that they would prefer to sit in a coffee shop and take a walk with a frowning Ilya. Weasel turned around and saw Danger with Red.   Ron was dressed as he always was - bland and unkempt, and Hermione looked like a regular London schoolgirl. For a moment, Ilya thought about the fact that Ronald was always ready to have a fist fight. So he could, for instance, punch him now, and start a fistfight. But with so many witnesses, Ilya would probably be stripped of up to a hundred points and a couple of hours of lectures with Snape, even scarier than the fiery Geena. The lectures were scary in their sizzle and universal boredom.   - What do you want? - Weasel grumbled.   - Mrs. Weasley asked me to keep an eye on you," Hermione replied, as if it were a matter of course.   - Get lost," Ilya muttered, and turned a hundred and eighty and staggered towards Hogsmeade, but he was grabbed rather sharply by the elbow.   - We're going together," Hermione said firmly.   It was obvious that Ron wasn't happy about the prospect and supported the Slytherin's wish. The wish was for the slug to get the hell out of here.   - Where I go, you don't go.   - And where did you...   - The Cabana's Head.   - But it's only accessible from seventeen! - Danger exclaimed.   Ilya raised his right eyebrow skeptically and glared at the girl. She immediately hesitated and felt embarrassed. It was immediately clear that if he did not ask for documents, Ilya would be able to safely enter this place.   - And what are you going to do there?   - Shit! I'll eat porridge and drink milk! Get out of here, you little brat!   Hermione let go of Ilya and pursed her lips, and Ron was about to jump in, but he caught Weasel's pleading gaze. It was like he was saying, "Please, I beg you, do something stupid and I'll be happy to break your breadcrumb. And Ronald stayed where he was, not shackled by fear, but simply confused. Ilya exhaled a little disappointed and wandered back down the beaten path.            Hogsmeade was just an ordinary English village. No ruins, no slanted fences, no broken-down roads. Everything was orderly, everything was well-maintained. Fences are matched to one another and always nicely painted. Houses, like clones of each other, are made of white brick and cherry planks. Gently tiled roofs, windows with flowers on the sill and sewn curtains. And a cobblestone paved road. If you didn't know it was a Magic Village, you wouldn't know it at once.   Ilya noticed that the door of one of the houses opened and an older woman flew in, hugging an older woman tightly. She must have been a local. There were about three dozen kids in Hog, and many of the younger ones were jealous of them. They said they could visit their parents more often, and in general they did not mind going to an ordinary, district school.   There was a woman's laughter, and then a distinctive sound. Ilya saw that George, hugging Alicia, had finally caught up with his kiss. A little ahead of them was Angelina, with Fred holding her waist. They walked to the Three Broomsticks, the most popular place in the neighborhood. They could eat there and drink a milkshake called "Creamy Beer.   Ilya's path lay elsewhere, past the Zonko shop, which was usually full of youngsters. Leaving behind the maddening Madame Puddifoot's, where the boys were lured by the craziest of ladies. Passing a series of different shops and a chain hotel for magicians, Dixon and Sons.   But a building loomed ahead, with the dried heads of some magical creatures at the entrance. The bar was relatively large, with a characteristic entourage and even a vintage Texas door - two flaps swiveling to either side. You might ask why it was so warm inside - magic, gentlemen, magic.   Ilya stepped closer and the heads bellowed in unison, but as soon as he pointed and middle finger, they fell silent. The flaps creaked open, attracting the visitors' attention for a moment, but then everyone went back to their business.   There were a relatively large number of people, and not the most intelligent-looking ones. There were some obvious businessmen, some information mongers, some peddlers with forbidden goods, but there were also those who came in for a drink as well.   Passing the old oak tables, firmly nailed to the floor, Weasel sat down on a high chair behind the bar riser. He unzipped his coat, took off his hat, laid it beside him, and tapped the bar with his palm. After a couple of seconds, a stoutly built old man approached him, wiping down a glass. It wasn't a secret, but little did anyone know that the local host, Abeforth, was also Albus Dumbledore's older brother. Few knew that, but Ilya did. Abeforth told him himself. And don't ask how and when they met, it's too long and tedious a story.   - Hello," Weasel waved a hand.   - Well, hello," the bartender said with a smirk. - What's your poison?      *(p.a. In Scottish, Canadian, Irish, American, British and probably, but I don't know - Australian bars, they ask "What'syourpoison? The phrase has no exact translation, but that's what it's supposed to sound like. )      - Something hot," he shrugged. - He shrugged. "I'm going to have to get some more of that.   - Wait for it.   And Abefort departed. Ilya got two coins in advance. One for the drink, the other for the food. The old man returned soon enough. In his right hand he carried a plate of fried onion rings, fries, and five aromatic ribs, and in his left a bottle of single malt whisky and a ribbed wide glass.   The host put a plate in front of the young man, putting him three napkins, but no knife or fork. Contrary to misconception, fried onions, fries, and ribs should be eaten with your hands. Abefort tossed two pieces of ice into the glass and poured three fingersfuls.   Ilya nodded and slid two coins forward. The barman took one, put the other in a special box, and wrote something in the book that said "Weasel. The ignorant would not say anything about it, but the knowledgeable would say that the second shekel had gone to the account of the fellow at the bar. You wouldn't think a three-finger whisky would cost nearly three pounds, would you?   Ilya nodded, tasted onions and potatoes, and then drank the whiskey. It cut his throat a little at first, but then honey spilled down his throat and a hot heat spread over his chest and stomach. Weasel put his fist to his mouth, exhaled sharply, and sank his teeth into a juicy, flavorful rib.   While Ilya ate and drank, he did not pay attention to what was happening, but he should have. A blizzard raged outside the window, and in an instant the windows were frozen to such a state that one could even hear them ghostly crackle. Shouts and light cursing could be heard of people seeking shelter from the harsh, aching cold. And the bar was filling faster and faster with people. Two young waitresses were barely able to keep up with the kitchen while the cooks must have had their work cut out for them.   - Hey, buddy," some body approached Ilya, eyeing around warily. - You're not interested in the silver girl?   Weasel could barely keep from choking on a rib. Muggles had their own demons, like heroin, but muggles had "silverware. A kind of powder that looked like stardust. You sniff it once, and it's like you're in heaven. At least, that's how the junkies described it. Yeah, don't believe anyone who says magic poisons aren't addictive. Bullshit. If you don't get addicted to it, you wouldn't make a profit and after the third puff you won't be able to imagine your life without the powder. And if you first push a dose of one gold, then six months later you will demand ten, if not more. In short, the scams are the same here as they are in Skary.   - How much?   - Ten shekels for half an ounce," the dealer sniffed, staring again.   Ilya quickly calculated that it came out to almost eighty pounds for fourteen grams.   - It's expensive," Ilya began to haggle.   - Come on, man, at Lyutnoy you'll get at least a fiver.   - Well, we're not in Lyutnoe," Ilya shrugged. He wiped the grease off with a napkin, and then, maneuvering his little finger away, he sipped his whiskey.   - All right, all right, eight shekels.   - Come on.   Ilya counted out the eight coins in his pocket, clenched them in his fist, and handed them to the peddler. He looked around again, and, pressing the paper envelope against his palm with his thumb a couple of centimeters, held out his hand - as if he wanted to say hello.   Suddenly weasel suddenly threw his left sharply, firmly squeezing the wrist bargain hunter.   - Hey, Abefort, you got cockroaches in here.   Diller was taken aback at first, but then he realized that it smelled like Azkaban baloney. He tried to break free at first, but Weasel had his wrist in a vice-like grip. Then he drew his wand. Ilya, scattering coins on the floor, simply ripped it out of the dealer's hands.   The bartender came up and, with a slight movement of his hand, sent a clever spill right into the head of the salesman. He collapsed and sat down on his chair as if he were drunk. The whole petty scene never drew any attention. Not even the clinking of coins evoked any emotion. Seekly Pryor swept his hand briskly away - magic had no effect on money.   - Everyone goes this way," Abefort shook his head, nodding to one of the bouncers.   These huge, austere-looking men were sitting at a separate table at the very entrance. The most overpowering one jumped up and carried him to the kitchen, like a feather. Further the fate of the businessman was clear - first they'll beat the shit out of him, and then bound and cut down, with the material docks in his pocket, will be thrown on the doorstep of the local department of Aurorat. He had to be in the middle of the night, and then he had to be tied up, knocked out of his pocket, and then thrown on the doorstep of the local Aurorat office.   Usually, of course, the money is knocked off, those who are more prinprincipled - "stage" in Tsugundera, and newcomers to the Ministry, and there is bound to have the roof of a pusher in the presence. But if the pusher is put out of business, he won't be able to sell anyway - if he's not sent to a hospital, he'll die. Bouncer probably break his legs and ribs, and not with his hands, but with some curses. Anyway, one way or another, this shrewd fellow would never come here again.   - I don't like druggies and bargain hunters," Ilya grimaced and wiped his hands on the napkins. Then he looked at the food and pushed it aside - his appetite was gone.   He gestured for a refill as he swallowed his glass. Abefort poured two fingers. That was the custom. Three if asked for with food, two if not. Of course, everybody wants money, but nobody wants a drunken customer.   - Should I give you a bonus? - The bartender snorted.   - Nah, put it on my tab for catching that ghoul.   - Well," the headmaster's brother shrugged, and was about to go to the other end of the counter when he turned around. - He was about to leave for the other end of the counter.   Weasel mentally cursed.   - Actually, I wanted to push her.   - Also a thought," and Abefort took off.   Ilya put the weapons he had won in the battle into his bag. Now he would have to share it with this old man. If he could get his wand on the black market at Lyutnoe for, say, five gold pieces, then Abeforth would have to shell out at least a dozen shekels, if not the whole galleon. Another waste - what an eye-opener the bartender here is...   Weasel, noticing that the bar is too crowded, decided that he should get out before the bartender cheated him for another percentage. After leaving seven kanats for tea, Ilya put on his earflaps, wrapped his coat and strode out.   He lingered a little on the threshold, but still strode resolutely out. The moment the "cowboy windows" (a.k.a. those doors were called that) creaked open behind him, weasel almost gnashed his teeth from the cold. Without thinking too much, the Slytherin except that he rushed to the Three Brooms. It was a quieter place than the Boar's Head, where he shouldn't be seen for months.   The front door creaked open, and a tall hanger approached Illya, hunching his shoulders in a bow. Weasel brushed aside the artifact, keeping his coat with him. The hanger, not the least bit upset, approached the next visitor.   Ilya looked around, but among the huge number of tables, he saw only more people. Everything was packed everywhere, and there was no chance to find a free seat. Though, there, in the distance, by the stairs leading to the upper floors with the rooms, was an inconspicuous table. Seated at it were the easily recognizable identities of Weasley and Granger. But what was more appealing was that they had a vacant chair. Ilya smirked - they asked to go with them themselves.   Weasel squeezed his way through the crowd and stepped closer, a loud chuckle drawing attention to himself. Ron and Hermione immediately looked up, but strangely, there was a look of confusion on their faces. It was as if they were scrambling to find a way out of the situation. Ilya was about to pull back a vacant chair and give the boys a nudge when he sensed, literally, that something was wrong.   Ilya sniffed the air and clearly distinguished that there were not two but three people sitting at the table. And the smell of the third was very familiar. Ilya put his hand down on a presumably empty space, but felt a man's shoulder under his palm.   - So we're dabbling in invisibility robes," the understanding Slytherin smirked. He wanded a chair to himself and sat down next to it. - That's how you used to follow me around in freshman year. Clever.   - What are you doing here, Ilya? - Potter's voice came from the void.   - Actually, your friends wanted to keep an eye on me at Mrs.'s request.   - And you left yourself," Ronald muttered.   - Hermione," Ilya let that statement slip past his ears, and then lied easily. - I'm sorry I snapped, I didn't mean to offend.   The girl snorted and shrugged, showing that she didn't care.   - Fine," Ilya smiled, pleased that the conspirators weren't holding a grudge against him. They could be more trouble than a disgruntled McGee.   The waitress passed by, and Ilya, who knew what to do, beckoned her. The girl smiled radiantly at Ilya and accepted the order and in a couple of minutes there was a mug of hot chocolate on the table. Weasel put his hands on the walls of the container and blissfully exhaled. The heat seemed to be absorbed into the guy, slowly "warming up" what the whiskey had not warmed.   - We actually wanted to talk," Granger remarked.   - About how great it would be to find out all about Black?   The trio choked, but no one knew what Potter choked on. Invisible people are like that.   - How did you...   - I'm Ilya," the still somewhat boastful young man shrugged. - There's nothing I don't know.   - Well, well," Hermione said, cryptic for some reason.   Weasel wanted to say that he had even guessed against his will about her time-wheel, but decided that was unnecessary. Let the girl remain blissfully unaware that the Slytherin knew everything. The funny thing was, her friends had no idea, and Ilya had cracked the riddle without even intending to. It was just that at some point it was no longer possible not to understand.   Weasel was about to answer something like that, though, when new actors entered the room - Madame Rosmerta, the pub landlady, Professor McGonagall, and, surprisingly, Minister Fudge. They were joined by Flitwick, who had inexplicably come from nowhere, and some other man.   For some part, the goblin noticed Ilya, who in turn nodded to the enchantment master, but it was clear that in this case, Filius would have preferred to have the conversation elsewhere.   - Oh, you're the Minister," Rosmerta began to rant, her arms folded into her rather large sides. - Come to see your own handiwork? ?? I've had all my visitors dispersed by my Dementors!   - Rosmerta, dear," the minister held up his hands in a conciliatory gesture, trying to placate the hostess. - You do realize this is all because of Black.   - Black," the pub-keeper grimaced, and she looked down at him. - What a lad she'd been... And what a friend of the Potters...   - Rosmerta! - McGonagall shouted slightly, nodding discreetly at Red and Danger. - Not here.   - Oh, yes, why am I keeping you in the hall, let's go upstairs.   And the four wizards began to walk up the stairs leading to the rooms. Before anyone knew it, there was the sound of a chair pulling back, and the rustling of cloth on the wooden floor.   - Harry! - Hermione hissed, but Potter was already scurrying up the stairs, judging by the smell.   - Oh, yeah," Ilya stretched out, throwing his legs up on the chair he had vacated.   - So what do we do? - is, as I'm sure you can understand, Ronald asked.   - Waiting. - Granger muttered heavily.   Ilya smiled victoriously and closed his eyes. Somehow the darkness fell, the sounds became many times clearer, as if someone turned a switch, amplifying them several times, but Ilya was not concerned with the hubbub of the crowd of visitors. He mentally climbed the stairs, leaving the background noise and commotion behind, and just as mentally put his ear to the keyhole and listened to the voices. They sounded quiet at first, as if from under the floor, but the more Ilya listened, the more clearly he distinguished the words, and soon he understood the whole speech.   - Such a tragedy, such a tragedy, but what a good, what a good man he was.   - A lot of people would disagree with you, dear. The things he and Potter did together.   - But when they were young, when they were hot, oh, how sad... Do you remember, Professor Flitwick, how they blew up the Christmas tree in the third year?   - I remember.   - But how come, how come...   - People change, Rosmerta," it was probably McGee, but the tone of the voices was hard to distinguish, like they were one color. After all, Ilya wasn't a beast to distinguish that, either.   - But not in a couple of years. After all, both of them had fought the Dark Lord after high school. What kind of friends they were, like brothers... There was no water to spill...   - If memory serves, Black was best man at Mr. and Mrs. Potter's wedding?   - Of course it was. The whole foursome was there, but Black was the only one standing at the altar with his friend. The closest, most loyal...   - who ended up a traitor, who'd have thought... All that's left of Pittagrew is a finger, just his little finger.   There was the creak of a door and the sharp thump of boots on the stairs. It was Potter - no doubt about it. He stormed out of the place, and his friends rushed after him. Ilya decided to stay and listen.   - According to the guards, before he escaped, Black kept saying, "He's at Hogwarts, he's at Hogwarts." So don't be angry, Rosmerta, it's just the way things are these days.   - Yeah, I get it. It must be hard for Harry.   - He doesn't know everything about Black - he hasn't been told.   - Well, that's right, you don't need to know that - you can't.   - But the most surprising thing," the voice, which probably belonged to the Minister, interjected again. -Bellatrix Lestrange, sitting in the next cell, was acting strangely, too.   - Wasn't it always like this?   - In a way, yes, but now she's literally staggering. She's cowering in a corner, trembling with fear, crying out, "He's coming for me, he's coming for me. The Dementors say there's never been such fear from prisoners before.   - Who could Leistrange be so afraid of?   - Who knows, who knows. Maybe he thinks Frank and Alice's son is coming for revenge...   Ilya wouldn't listen to any further. He didn't want to miss all the fun that would start when Ron and Hermione caught up with Potter. And that there would be fun was not to be doubted. Weasel left a few bronze coins for tea this time too, put on his earflaps again, and pulled his coat up and headed for the exit.   There was still a strong northerly wind blowing outside, bringing with it a real blizzard. Probably those Russians would have laughed now, saying that it was not a blizzard but just a light weather, but Ilya had enough of that. In a moment lashes were frozen, except that they acquired icicles, eyes hurt and skin on the lips began to stretch like rubber balloons. It was cold. Ilya hated the cold, but curiosity drove him on.   Despite the cold, Ilya was able to make out the scents in the air. Like a bloodhound, sipping his nose, he walked toward the edge of the forest. People were still wandering around, seeking shelter, wandering either into Rosmerta's pub or Abefort's bar. But the closer he got to the forest, the fewer passersby and the laughing boys sheltering the girls from the cold with their bodies.   To many people the forest in winter seemed something surrealistically beautiful. All those snow caps, the firs, dressed in fluffy mantles, snowy glades and paths, the play of light in the ice crystals, but Ilya did not like the winter forest. Winter forest was silent, it told him nothing, there were no animals, no birds, exactly nothing. And the deeper weasel climbed into the winter forest, the more he wanted to sleep. Eyes fell asleep, he wanted to wrap himself deep in warm clothes. Fall in somewhere and wake up a couple of times a day for a few hours to eat. But weasel could easily cope with this obsession - only part of him wanted to sleep, and the other part felt quite normal.   At last among the trees Ilya discerned three figures. The tallest was standing beside the stocky one, sitting on a stump, and the third, huddled in a lumpy embrace with the stocky one. If Ron was jealous of his friend, he hid it quite successfully. But that was of little concern to Ilya. He seemed to be in time for the fun part. Potter was almost choking back tears and clenching his little fists. It was a pitiful sight. The only thing Ilya couldn't tolerate stronger than weakness was tears - no matter if they were male or female. They always enraged him. However, it was the men's, and the women's tears caused confusion mixed with irritation.   - They believed him," Ilya heard him sobbing. Illya wanted to punch Potter in the face. What self-respecting guy would whine in front of a girl. That's it, after a feint like that in the eyes of any worthwhile lady, you'd be beneath the plinth. - They believed, and he betrayed them! Betrayed them!   - Harry... - Hermione whispered, but she couldn't find words of comfort.   She simply couldn't understand Potter. And not many people could - Neville could, the sixth-year Puffendup orphan could, Ilya could, but he didn't want to understand such weakness. His understanding was simple - kill your enemy, live happily ever after. No tears, no worries, just the moment and the joy in that moment. There was no yesterday and no tomorrow, only now. But to live with such principles you have to live most of your life in Scari, when remembering yesterday you want to howl, tearing your throat open, and tomorrow is better not to think, because it may not exist. No, Illya didn't want to understand these home kids.   - I will find him and... ...and I will have my revenge. You hear me? I'm gonna kill him!   Ron and Hermione looked confused, and Potter's cheeks were already glistening with frozen tear tracks. Here Ilya just couldn't help himself and gave vent to his winter irritation. In the clearing, amidst the snow and wind, a laughter that sounded like springtime dripping began, but even so, it was very, very hurtful.   Potter glared menacingly in Ilya's direction, Ron clenched his fists, Hermione pursed her lips, and Ilya still couldn't stop himself. He leaned against a tree and laughed. He wasn't just laughing at Trio, he was laughing at the fact That he realized how much different he was from the wizards living in the castle. Not just in appearance, not just in power, but in the way he looked at life. Once it seemed to him that these magicians are abnormal, but now Ilyev suddenly became clearly understood - abnormal himself, his childhood, its values, principles and concepts, all this is not normal for a civilized society, in all it stinks too much Scary-square. And it was getting ridiculous that he wanted to be as naive and simple as Potter for a moment, he wanted to, but he could not. As Flitwick said rightly, only the few can understand, and only such people should be held. Ilya had no one to hold on to in the wizarding world...   - Oh, you're such a jerk," Weasel wiped away his tears and mocked Goggles. - "I'll kill him!" Ha-ha-ha-ha.   - You... - Ronald growled.   - He was in the middle of a tears, and he pulled out his wand and threw a stunner or a spell at Black. Potter would pull out his wand, crying, and throw stunners or cotton-foot spells at Black! But no, beforehand, I'm sure you'd apply the skill of forgiveness and universal justice and send Black to the authorities.   - What do you mean by that? - Granger hissed, getting to her feet and shutting Potter down for some reason.   That's what Ilya was talking about. Hermione is already instinctively holding her mate up as a wuss, and her maternal instinct for protection kicks in. Abomination...   - What I say," Weasel shrugged. - Potter's a whiner, a weakling, and a sissy. And a fool, too.   - You don't talk about Harry like that! - wailed Ronald. - You take that back right now!   - Please, Red, make me do it - take them back.   No one stopped Weasley this time, and he raised his wand. At that moment, white lightning flashed through the space. Ron collapsed in the snow, pressing his hand to his cheek, blood gushing from it. Beside him lay a sharp icicle, tossed with the force of a steel bolt from a crossbow.   - It didn't work out, did it? - Ilya smirked.   He felt perfect. Finally a fight, finally a heart beating so fast and desperate, so easy to breathe and so bright in color. At last he felt warm...   Hermione tried to conjure something, but Ilya was faster. He shot out a binding spell and Hermione's arm was tethered tightly to her body in an instant. The wand glanced neatly at her feet. With the next spell, Weasel easily dropped the girl into the snow, so that she had no chance of doing anything.   - One at a time, Potter. Just the way you like it - all Gryffindor style.   Harry, getting into his battle swing, didn't think for long. He raised his wand and bellowed loudly:   - Expulsio!   Ilya literally felt a wall of compressed air coming at him. On reflexes and reaction alone, the Slytherin made a dizzying leap, finding himself far away from the impact zone. Then there was an explosion. The snow was blown to shreds, several trees were broken, lumps of earth flew into the air, and a crater of considerable size formed where Weasel had been standing.   Potter, like all wizards his age, froze, staring at the work of his hands and it cost him everything. Ilya's wand flickered, merging into a single ball of fire, the Elder Runes whistling in the air, the non-verbal formula whispered mentally, and then the verbal:   - Ignis Flamantis!   Once upon a time a maniac had said that Ilya didn't have the strength for the Flaming Lash, but he was wrong - Ilya did. But Ilya found this spell too unwieldy, too cheesy, too lacking in grace, charm, style, and everything that Weasel and Flitwick valued so much. So Ilya created his own charms-the Flaming Whip charms. You could cut with it, you could punch with it, you could burn with it, or you could use it instead of that very whip. Easy, elegant, and deadly.   The Flaming Whip (one of the four spells that had nothing to do with the Flaming Beasts) clicked, and Potter's wand flew out of his hands. Harry grimaced - a huge bruise was sprawling on his arm. Ilya didn't want to burn it - it wasn't worth leaving such an obvious mark on it.   Another swing of his wand and the whip wrapped around Potter's neck, squeezing it in a vise. Harry grasped the fiery whip with his hands, but he didn't have a chance to release the vice. Just then Ron began to come to, recovering from the pain and shock, but Ginger didn't have a chance - Ilya's shoe had already slammed into his face.   - It's not like killing enslaved basilisks on swords or shoving sticks up trolls' noses, Potter. To kill is to take everything from a man and watch as the light slowly fades in his eyes, as fear mingles with awakening, as the cold breath of Death blows. To kill is to leave someone an orphan, someone a widow. To take a son or a daughter, a friend or a brother. You make it sound so simple - to kill... It's a good thing you don't know what Scary Square is, or you'd never say the word. If you're going to kill and you don't, then you're a nobody, a nobody, a nobody...   With each word, the whip slowly tightened around Potter's throat, and he wheezed and whistled.   - A bunch of house kids throwing around such loud words," Ilya wanted to throw his wand aside and punch the chatterbox in the face with a pull, but he didn't do it. He just knew that he would regret the breakdown in the spring, when he would be warm again.   - Stop it! - Hermione screamed. - You're strangling him!   - You see," Ilya grinned. - You're not dead yet, and they're already crying about you. Even for a lowlife like you.   Weasel loosened his grip, and Potter collapsed to the ground. He was slowly regaining consciousness, gasping for air with his mouth.   - Snotlout," Ilya spat, and then reminded himself why he'd arranged all this. - If you ever try to "look out" for me again, much less say it in public, I'll give you hell on earth. So long, pups.   And Ilya staggered back to the castle, feeling gradually colder and colder again. Ilya hated winter, hated the cold, but he did not know yet that very soon he would hate it even more... The holidays were approaching.      Chapter 28.   December 24, 1993 England, Hogwarts                   The last day of school was held, as always. Everyone and everyone, including the teachers, didn't give a damn about school. Everyone lived in anticipation of the evening's festive dinner, followed by the departure from the alma mater of all the wizards of Foggy Albion. But even so, there were exceptions in the castle. Namely Professor McGonagall and her protg, Hermione Granger.   The day was wrapping up horribly today. If there was only one pair of Herbalism before lunch, there were two pairs of Transfiguration after the window and lunch. Get a load of that. Two. Pairs. Transfiguration. Sure, on paper, it's just a bunch of letters, carrying images of simple numbers, but in practice... In practice, it's three hours with the Iron Lady and the nerdy Danger.   Ilya could endure a lot. The winter, the rabid iron golems, the neighborhood with Slabozady and his crew, the potions lessons, but three hours with the Dean of Scarlet and the school's head crammer, it was like punishment from heaven. Weasel, lying on his desk, his cheek propped on his hand, with a completely blank and absent look all trying to understand what he was so wrong that the all-forgiving god decided so to overthrow him. But no matter how much Ilya dug into his memories, he could not find fault.   Of course, maybe, just maybe, you should not have mined the deputy director's office last month, and then detonated five stink bombs there. It was not necessary to put invisible buttons on her chair and put in her coffee magic hair dye, and those blasphemous poems were also unnecessary ... The only thing is that they were innocent children's pranks, and they did not deserve such terrible punishment. For example, Snape was treated even worse - he still searches everyone for offensive pictures, but nothing - no reinforced doses of the Half-haired Man.   - Mr. Ilya, what are you doing in my class?   - Just pondering the eternal, ma'am," muttered Weasel, still staring blankly at one point.   - What did you have in mind? - With a touch of sarcasm, McGee asked.   - That the eternal is eternal. Isn't that a revolutionary discovery?   - Minus twenty points for rudeness," the professor cut her off sharply.   - You see, ma'am," sighed Ilya. - You haven't grasped that level of zen yet, you can't understand the eternal.   - I'll charge you half a hundred more if you don't show me a job well done.   - What do I care about points, ma'am, when I see the eternal...   - Minus...   - Wait, wait," Ilya waved his hand. - It seems that the eternal, offended by you, has departed. Well, then I can go back to the mortal earth, where the only things that matter to people are points and completed tasks.   Weasel turned to the mouse, winked at it, waved his wand, said the formula, and a bright green parrot with a red beak appeared on the table. Ilya felt a strong weakness, but anticipated what was to happen in a moment.   The little bird opened its beak and shouted to the whole audience:   - Maaaa k-G-G-G-Gi durr-r-r-r-ra! Maa k-G-G-Gi durr-r-r-ah!   A wave of laughter swept through the office, and Ilya, according to a well-established pattern, left the accessories in a bag and flew out the door. This time he did not even clap them - so as not to drown out the parrot's dithyrambs. And don't even ask how Ilya pulled off this trick - real weasels don't reveal their secrets.   Ilya, bag slung over his shoulder, hat pulled down over his eyes, shivering in the rare cold wind, staggered toward Flitwick.   This time we had to work hard to come up with Christmas presents for him and the director. Of course for people in such an advanced age it is difficult to think of gifts, because they either already have everything or don't need anything. So it is not surprising that Ilya stopped at books, but what kind of books can be given to people who have read tens, if not hundreds of thousands of works in their lifetime.   The answer, however, was found; Ilya sent the Headmaster a historical fantasy by a very famous author, and Flitwick a book of recipes. Yes, yes, a book of recipes. It was just that at some point the goblin had once mentioned that he was quite curious about how Muggles cook without magic, so now he had to figure out what and why.   Ilya himself was relatively unable to cook. Exactly, he could not. Ilya could make himself a sandwich, heat up a half-finished meal, but to cook from scratch... that was beyond him. However, Ilya could always tell by the smell of the cafe, which would get the freshest and best, after consuming which there would be no desire to live in the apartment "white friend".   This also applied to street vendors. If you want to try a proper burrito or a hot dog, don't forget to ask Weasel where they sell them, otherwise you are guaranteed some problems.   Weasel came out to Hog's main "artery" - the stairs. It was as if they were trembling with anticipation of another amusement. The problem was that the secret passages leading upstairs were in another wing. So after the Transfiguration class weasel had no chance of getting past those wooden bitches.   Ilya slung the bag over his shoulder, tightening the strap so that the tube dangled more under his butt than it did at his side. Then he adjusted his hat, crunched his fingers and cervical vertebrae, and jumped on the first one. It sprang into action at once, vaporized a few steps and flew off in the wrong direction. But he, who had already learned by bitter experience, did not try to be funny and jumped on the railing.   Spreading out, Weasel ducked over the gaping gap and hooked his fingers on the next platform, jumped onto the next railing in one cohesive motion. Alas, this ladder proved more treacherous - it flew down. So Illya summoned the Flaming Whip and used it as a liana. After playing Tarzan, Ilya did end up on the fifth floor level. Here he ignored the stairs and began to climb the protruding wall bas-relief.   Then, at the very edge of the bas-relief, he pushed off with his legs and swooped down to the other ladder. It tried to swim away, but did not have time, and weasel caught on it. Another tug, a leap, a run up the steps disappearing under his feet, and here Ilya was at his goal.   Ilya stopped, turned around, bent his right hand and struck the bend with his left, at the same time straightening the middle finger of his right. The ladders squeaked and cracked and began to return to their previous position. The silliest thing about this whole situation is that they only behaved this way when Ilya was alone. So even if I told anyone, they wouldn't believe it.   The Slytherin slung the bag onto one shoulder, loosened the strap as much as possible so that the bag wasn't hanging off his knee, lifted his hat slightly, and moved down the corridor. The walls were playfully flickering with the glow of magic torches. Sometimes the tapestries whirred, lending an all too palpable sense of reality to the intricately woven images. At times the tapestries seemed to suggest the appearance of a dragon about to burst forth and attack the knights' armor standing nearby. Pieces of an ancient mosaic could be seen on the ceiling, but it never made it to the present day. Yet despite all its shortcomings, Hogwarts was an amazing place, full of magic and joy. And Ilya was unspeakably glad that he had a chance to study here and absorb the inexpressible atmosphere of endless adventure.   Ilya knocked and, as always, he heard:   - Come in, Ilya.   Ilya opened the door and immediately smiled. No matter what was going on outside the castle walls, it was always spring in this office. It was warm, cozy, spacious, and not at all cold. From December to February the young wizard of Scary Square tried to spend as much time as possible in this place. Otherwise he risked snapping and hurting someone, which he would surely regret.   Ilya made his way to the cozy chair, which he already knew was his own. He sat down there, folding his bag at his feet and immediately grabbed a cup of hot chocolate, warming himself against its warmth. Flitwick, on the other hand, was chewing on his quill, as usual, calculating another formula.   - What are you working on, Professor? - Ilya asked, popping a liver into his mouth.   - Over the masterpiece, Ilya, over the masterpiece," the old man smiled a little sadly for some reason.   - And what is this masterpiece going to be? And no, no, no, don't tell me, I already know - you want to create a singing pink elephant!   - I was actually considering Cheburashka, but an elephant isn't a bad idea either.   - I knew it! Sir, I've got you figured out! - the lad laughed.   - I'm afraid," the enchanter said with a wave of his hands. - I didn't have a chance to resist.   - That's right, Professor! Fear Ilya Ilya the genius third year.   The goblin smiled for a fraction, then coughed into his handkerchief and, with a moment's glance at the white cloth, quickly tucked it into his pocket. Flitwick glanced at his calculations, then stacked the sheets of parchment and placed them on the edge of the table.   - I heard a parrot singing in transfiguration class half an hour ago...   - I've always been amazed at your awareness.   - I was in the middle of the night," he said, and then he reached for the cup as well. Usually he held it by the ear with his little finger, but now for some reason he held it with both hands. - Be more careful in the future, Ilya, parrots are parrots, but the diploma is an important thing.   - I can't promise you that," the brunette shook his head theatrically.   - I didn't get my hopes up," the old wizard smiled again, a little sadly. - How were the last few days, Ilya?   - I've almost finished the fifth beast," Ilya raised his chin haughtily.   - You mean "fifth animals"?   - Exactly, sir!   You might be surprised that Flitwick knew about Ilya's classes, but, really, you shouldn't be. After all, he was the only one who knew. Apart from Illya himself, of course. Filius, the old rascal, picked up a liver with his fingernail and sent it flying picturesquely, ending up in the master's mouth. Ilya goggled his eyes and a moment later tried to do the same, but the liver hit his eye.   - It seems you haven't mastered all my tricks yet, Ilya," the goblin smirked smugly at some point.   - I still have time to catch up with you," Ilya waved his hand.   - The time... - Flitwick stretched out and glanced at his watch on a chain. - Yes, you still have so much time Ilya. But don't waste it. It will end someday and I would not want you to be afraid or ashamed to turn around and look at the time you have lived.   - As always - well said, sir!   Flitwick gave a deliberately loud squelch and the young man smiled, the professor smiled as well, then they laughed for a while longer. It seemed like nothing, nothing to laugh about, but they were having fun nonetheless. Filius put his hand on the thick folder with the calculations, then on Ilya wiping away tears and nodded. Just like that - to himself.   - You know, Ilya, I have forty-three reports on you in my desk in the last month alone.   - A new record," Ilya said with bravado.   - Alas, I don't understand how you, with such discipline, manage to remain a Top Student.   - I'm just trying to prove that marks and discipline lie on different planes.   Flitwick grunted, trying to hide the chuckle, and pulled out a new vase of brownies. Ilya's eyes glittered greedily, which made the world-famous duelist laugh again.   - Someday you'll wish you hadn't been so heavy on sweets," the professor said as he held the vase out to him.   - Medicine," Ilya clutched the bouchette. - works wonders. Especially magic medicine.   They were silent, occasionally crunching sweets and slurping hot drinks. Outside the window the snowfall of fluffy snowflakes was whirling in a bizarre dance, but in the spacious office, it seemed that spring had frozen forever. It smelled of first flowers, swelling buds, awakening trees, and fresh grass. Ilya loved this place, it was something alive in the sometimes dead castle.   - Do you have your key with you? - suddenly asked the master of spells.   - You're insulting," Ilya shook his head, pulling out the right thing from his inside pocket. - I always carry it with me.   - I didn't doubt it," Flitwick smiled and held out his hand. - May I?   Ilya immediately put the key into his wrinkled palm. Filius looked at the "little bugger" - as Hagrid called them - then swiped his fingernail and returned it to the young man.   - I hope you remember our agreement. - squinted at some part of the goblin.   - No one is to enter while you are not in the castle," Weasel almost gestured.   - You couldn't have said it better," Filius nodded.   Ilya put away the key to the office and ran his fingers over the cakes, choosing which one to eat at a given moment. Finally the young man made his choice. He moved it to a separate saucer, then measured himself, and slammed his palm on the edge. The pastry flew into the air, and he grabbed it with his teeth.   - Hahiyefo frcky I hwyufil! - With his mouth full, the Slytherin smiled.   - Bravo, Ilya!" laughed Flitwick. - By the way, Mr. Ilya, there are already legends about your concerts around the castle, and I have never heard you play the guitar.   Weasel gasped, then pounded his chest, looked at the professor, and blushed thickly.   - ?... it's... but... - then the young man abruptly jumped up and yelled. - One moment!   The lad, holding up his hat, ran to the other end of the study, where there was a stand with a case. Weasel took it off, unzipped it, and pulled the little girl out into the light. She was still the same as before. A six-stringed beauty with scarlet-green glowing veins. Muggles, when they saw her, would ask where they could order such a design, but Weasel just grinned enigmatically and answered that you had to know the places.   Weasel went back, put the base "waist down" on his hip, and fiddled with the strings. He tweaked the pegs a little, hearing the tuning, then went over the frets again and nodded contentedly.   - Ladies and gentlemen! - he shouted. - Hear, hear! Behind the instrument the best artist of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the future artist of the greatest theatres, as well as not yet crowned, but will be crowned as the King of Rock - Geeeeeeeeerbert Ilya!   And Weasel, having strummed the first chord, began to play. At first he played his most favourite compositions. Sometimes they were riffs of very famous guitarists, and sometimes they were compositions heard in the passages. Students and ordinary street musicians played them, but music was beautiful because it was not important who played it, it was important how, it was important that the notes contained not only laws and rules, but the soul.   Ilya, eyes covered, kept playing. His only listener, the old, little wizard with the big, warm heart, Philius Flitwick, leaned back in his chair and lowered his eyelids as well. The tension was gone from his face, his forehead wrinkles smoothed, his breathing evened out.   The two mages never saw the window thaw, the flames that had recently been in chaos suddenly take on some shape and begin to dance gently. They did not see so much of what was going on around them, but they heard even more. They heard quiet notes, and frisky arrangements, cheerful and sometimes lyrical chords of the oldest and literally newborn compositions.   Ilya was lost in the music, dissolving in it completely, giving himself up without a trace. And in that moment both the unhappy Prince and the impenetrable Ugly disappeared. Both of them were dissolving, disappearing like morning mist, giving chance to something more whole, to something more correct and real. Giving a chance to a third, so small, so weak, but also just as great and resilient. Resilient as a rock, over which the worst storm can rage, the most terrible storm, rain stone and split the heavens, but still stand.   Ilya played his old, broken guitar, which even after repair was covered in cracks and even characteristic bullet holes, but he didn't care about that. He didn't care about mysteries and riddles and wizards and creatures and magical creatures. He didn't even care who he was, where he was coming from, or where he was going. He didn't care about anything. All that mattered was the six strings stretched and ten fingers running across them. That was all that mattered. That alone was the essence of what the Prince and the Ugly Man had so securely concealed, waiting for the moment when it could be handed to the one who would not break it by dropping it out of fear.   You could say, "after so much time," but that would be a lie. For time, too, was frozen, listening to the music. It curled up and settled on the young man's lap, slowing its pace, literally vaporizing him. You couldn't tell if you were listening for ten minutes, twenty, an hour, or three. No one even thought about it-about time, though.   So let's say that at some point Ilya switched to his own compositions. Yes, they seemed to him incomplete, unfinished, a little ugly, but nevertheless they were a part of him and it was impossible to refuse them so easily. What's more, it was impossible to give them up at all.   And the weasel began to play. He played "Hide and Seek with the Leaves" and "Morning Dream" and "The Seventh Day of Summer", and even his new riff, which nobody had heard yet. This riff was not the most cheerful, even, perhaps, the most lyrical of Ilya's repertoire, whose music was always characterized by positivity and lightness.   But this composition, this composition was calm, measured and even somewhat philosophical. The composition, in which there was so much that it was difficult to choose a name, but the young man coped with it. And now on the cipher paper (in fact, on the music records) it was called "The Last Cigarette". It was probably the stupidest name one could think of for such a riff, but Ilya thought that it suited the music very well.   And again - at some point the music faded away. The last tones faded away, the echoes and the distant echoes faded away. The concert was given and finished, and together with its end, the third one fell asleep, waiting for the moment when he would not need neither the Prince nor the Ugly. He fell asleep, sinking into beautiful dreams, not available to anyone else.   There was silence in the office for some time, and Ilya awaited the verdict with genuine excitement.   - It's definitely yours, Ilya. One day, everyone will admit it.   Ilya smiled and nodded his head. It was already getting dark outside the window. Snow crystals glimmered in the moonlight, pure silver, and it looked as if the forest and the edge of the forest were covered in a metallic film, or maybe it was the work of a giant jeweler.   - Thank you, Ilya," said the professor, alluding to the concert.   He hesitated, then smiled piratically and raised his hat.   - You're welcome, Professor. Absolutely nothing.   Flitwick smiled and glanced at his watch.   - Uh-oh-oh. Young man, we've stayed too long with you, and you have a holiday to get ready for.   - Oh, shit! Um... excuse me sir, I have to run!   Ilya flew through the classroom like a hurricane - he put his guitar away, took his bag, washed and wiped his hands. Then he ran to the door and opened it eagerly, but, as it often happened, Filius called out to him.   - All the best to you, future King of Rock - Ilya.   Weasel froze and looked at the old man, who was behaving too strangely today.   - See you later, Professor," the young man said.   Filius Flitwick never showed up for Christmas dinner.                  January 2, 1994 England, Hogwarts                   Ilya, wrapped in a blanket, his legs propped up, was sitting on the couch in front of the blazing fireplace. On his lap lay a voluminous book about one of the most famous pirates. Ilya had just gotten to the point where this most famous corsair had been hired by the Queen to lead her fleet into battle against the Armada Invincible. Ilya, from general erudition, knew how the story would end, but still he read with genuine enthusiasm. At times he even dreamed of those times. Free gentlemen, living for the moment, refined ladies in fancy dresses, knowledgeable in poetry, music and dance. Feasts, battles, intrigue, love... Yes, it was a beautiful time, if you look at the books, of course... Well, romantic allusions aside, Ilya was, perhaps, happy to have been born at that time and in that era.    - No, your cat ate my poor Shorty! - Ron yelled.   Didn't they tell you? No? I apologize for that oversight-Ilya was sitting in the lions' living room. The scarlet ones had the most people staying for the holidays, and they were the warmest. The whole castle was warm, though, compared to the dank, icy dungeons.   Looking at Ginger and Danger, who had found a second reason to fight (the first being that Starter had ratted out Potter's Lightning to her dean), Ilya still wished he'd gone back in time. And there, in that come-as-you-book past, a self-respecting gentleman wouldn't yell at a lady. He would simply pretend that the lady did not exist.   - It's your own fault! You didn't look after your rat! And Bellybutton didn't eat her, she just ran away from such a host!   And the lady would never have shouted back. She would have covered herself with a fan and stepped aside. After all, shouting was not worthy of an unquestionably beautiful lady. Of course Granger wasn't unquestionably beautiful, and she wasn't just beautiful, either, but she did consider herself a lady.   In fact, Ilya, from the smell, realized that the cat clearly hadn't eaten a rat, and in fact had been living on the usual exceptions for a long time, but was in no hurry to reveal this mystery. Weasley and Granger's scolding had a dual impact. In some ways it was really annoying, but on the other, it was quite amusing, and somehow it dispelled the boredom.   For a while Ilya waited for Potter to join in the verbal altercation, but he, as usual, remained neutral. He sat quietly on the sidelines, leafing through a photo album. He'd even forgiven Danger for snitching about his Christmas present, a broomstick. Potter had gotten himself the fastest, best sports broom in the world, the Lightning, which was still only in "beta-testing" stage. That is, the prototype was not just difficult, but almost impossible to get, even scary to imagine how much it cost. However, the release was announced for May of this year...   But don't think that Ilya was in no way jealous of Ochkarik. He had a Dror, not as fast, but much more maneuverable. Besides Ilya earned this broom by his own forces, persistently training for some years, even breaking the school schedule. And, believe me, what you get with your own sweat, pain and sometimes even blood is much closer to your heart than any gift.   - I don't want that animal in my living room anymore!   - This is not your living room! And the Bellybutton will walk wherever he wants!   Ilya couldn't hear any further arguments because he... fell asleep. Yes, yes, just fell asleep. In the midst of winter, Ilya wanted to sleep even far away from the Forest. And this time he had no reason to resist the desire. Weasel fell asleep and had a strange dream in which he and Flitwick sat in his study, drinking tea, dangling his feet in the air as he had done long ago, when growth still allowed it, and telling silly things, while Flitwick smiled as if it was all very interesting to him... Or maybe he really was.                  January 26, 1994 England Hogwarts                   The vacation flew by at the speed of a fighter jet, leaving behind only an audible clap. For the most part, Ilya spent the whole time working, reading, listening, or playing music. Of course he also trained in the den, performing Animagic rituals, but that was more of a daily routine and didn't require any token of attention. Ilya had also been soaking his gifts for a while. Dumbledore had given him a set of false beards and moustaches. Ilya tried them all on, but found the most suitable one to be an espagnolo. So Ilya decided on how he would shave. Well, Flitwick made a royal gift, literally and figuratively. He gave him an Elvis record from the very first issue. And it was signed. It is frightening to imagine how much such a thing was worth among Muggle collectors. At the very least, a fortune.   Ilya, not believing his eyes at first, ran to put Filch on the spear. The janitor, you can be sure, did not even understand what's what. But by the evening Weasel had acquired a glazed frame, in which he inserted the vinyl. Such a thing can not be stored casually, but you can put on a loss, well... only if the end of the world is coming and really need to burn out for the last time.   Ilya measured his height after the holidays and realized that he had stretched himself even further in six months. Now, according to his calculations, at sixteen he would be in his twenties, if not more. It was alarming, even disturbing, but since it was a mystery-free year, Ilya didn't worry about it.   What was unpleasant was that the first lesson after the holiday was with, who would you think - right, the Iron Lady. She, having rested during this time from Weasel, took to him with renewed vigor. Already from the first minutes of the lecture Ilya was exposed to an artillery bombardment of some tricky questions on a very confusing subject. That semester, the third year lions and snakes, ahead of the program, finished transmutations and now began the summoning of things. Do you have any idea how steep it is to create from nothing at least a box of matches? And how many formulas, calculations, rules and definitions are there? No, read a textbook on transfiguration and you'll find out! In general, it is surprising that Ilya managed to get as many as ten points for his vague answers. But nothing, Professor Flitwick is on vacation, but he will be back soon, and Ilya will show how to score points for complete, detailed answers, on clearly posed questions.   Ilya was soaking wet with brainstorming that he flopped back down at his desk with relish. Granger snorted, as she always did, and immediately reached for the ceiling with her hand. It didn't take McGonagall long and immediately lifted her minion from her seat. Apparently the Dean of Scarlet was upset that she had to give out points to Slytherin. So now she was intent on pouring stones into her own faculty clock as well.   - Miss Granger, tell us about the vector orientation of the materialization of a physical object.   Wisely worded question, with the simplest answer - the object is formed from the bottom up. McGee likes everything to be scientific, to chew on the terms with his heel.   Danger was about to answer when the doors opened and the one who had not been expected showed up on the threshold. There was an instant silence in the classroom as everyone could make out the figure of Albus Dumbledore in the doorway. The headmaster was unusually collected, calm and even a little businesslike, which automatically alarmed every student... and the teacher, too.   - Mr. Ilya," said Dumbledore sternly. - Follow me, please.   - Director! - Ilya jumped to his feet and applied his most innocent face. - Honestly it wasn't me. People are all lying. I wasn't there at all! Slander! I want a lawyer and....   - A jury trial, yes, yes, I know. You're not being accused of anything, my boy.   - But then...   - Ilya, please, let's go and let's not delay the lesson.   Ilya, realizing that something really serious is going on, gathered his things and with the whispers of students and their glances, went out.   - Professor McGonagall," the Great Light Mage nodded.   - Headmaster," the Dean of Scarlet nodded in response and turned to the crowd. - Class, let's get on with it.   The doors closed and Ilya adjusted his hat. He used to rub his bandana tails when he was worried, now he adjusted his hat. These were gestures beyond his control; he didn't even notice them, which was not the case with the others.   - Mr. Ilya, I have some sad news for you. I would ask you to pull yourself together and be courageous and strong in such a difficult hour, but you have always amazed me with your fortitude.   - What is it, sir?   - Ilya, my boy, it pains me to say this, but...
